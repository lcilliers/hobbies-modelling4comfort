## Welcome

This is about my journey into the world of diorama modeling, scale models, and miniature craftsmanship.

## This Site

This site documents my passion for creating detailed diorama models, sharing the build process, techniques, and the creative journey of bringing miniature worlds to life. It all started off quite recently with accidentally building a model kit for my grandson, and from there it spiralled into a whole new focus, bringing much joy and comfort.

Here you'll find:

- **[Projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }})**: Gallery of completed and in-progress dioramas
- **[Build Logs]({{ '/builds/' | relative_url }})**: Step-by-step documentation of exploring new methods and materials while completing projects
- **[Techniques]({{ '/techniques/' | relative_url }})**: Tips, tricks, and detailed tutorials for methods I've learned along the way
- **[About]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }})**: Learn about my modeling journey and why "Models4Comfort"
