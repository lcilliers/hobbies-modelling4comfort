## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION

The Bookshop Memories was a birthday present.  This is a DIY Book Nook Kit currated by BookNookKit.com. The company was launched in 2018 and by now have in excess of 100 models with different the themes target at the adult model building market.  The range have a distinct style, lazer cut wooden pieces and lots of detail. The models have excellent instruction booklets. Fitting and installation quality is excellent.

It was great fun building this model and a good break from having to manufacture my own parts and design my own layout.

The size of the completed model is about the height of a mid size book, and the width of a couple of books.  It will display very well on a shelf, although mine landed on a display table.

Total build time was about 4-5 hours.  It did not present any issues or undue difficulty, but could be tricky for a novice or some someone that struggles with detail.

Looking through the booknookkit.com website, it does not appear that the model I build is still available, but they have lots of other similar models in their product portfolio.

## CHAPTER 1: THE BUILD
**Timeline:** 12-02-2025

### Initial Impressions

On opening the box (the size of a mid size book), all the parts were neatly packed and pre-numbered into plastic pockets. It most consisted of several lazer cut laminated wooden parts, printed parts on paper for cutting out, other small parts and the electric kit for the lighting.

### Kit Contents

The main components included:
- Structural pieces
- Decorative elements
- Lighting components
- Furniture and accessories
- Instructions quality
- Materials and tools needed

### Planning the Build

I first worked through the instructions to identify all the parts and neatly placed them in a box, still within the plastic pockets, to be easily accessed when called for. From previous experience, I do not take anything apart and out of their pockets until the instructions specifically call for the part.

The instructions are then meticulously followed, in order by first finding the related parts, do a dry run to assemble or fit the part, prepare the parts with light sanding or smoothing to get them ready for fit.  The steps included different methods of fixing, including glueing and pressure fit.  Most of the parts had to be pushed out of the lazer cut sheets or cut out with scissors.  It was particularly important to take time with cutting out to ensure that the correct cutting lines are used, and the precision was applied throughout.

it was particularly pleasant to build this model.  It was well designed, instructions was great, challenging enough to not be boring, and is a nice display piece.
