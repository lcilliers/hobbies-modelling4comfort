## Project Overview

A detailed scratch-built log cabin diorama set deep in the woods, featuring a handcrafted cabin structure, natural forest environment, and carefully prepared vegetation. This project showcases traditional log construction techniques scaled down, natural material preparation, and woodland scenery building.

**Scale:** 1:35  
**Build Time:** January - April 2024 (approximately 3 months)  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Status:** Completed

## Build Highlights

### Cabin Construction
The cabin was built from scratch using individual logs crafted to scale. Each log was carefully shaped, weathered, and assembled to create an authentic rustic appearance. The structure includes:
- Hand-crafted log walls with realistic bark texture
- Detailed corner notching
- Timber roof with weathered shingles
- Stone chimney with mortar detailing
- Front porch with supporting posts

### Natural Materials
Extensive use of natural materials collected and prepared specifically for the diorama:
- Real plant materials dried and preserved for trees and undergrowth
- Natural moss and lichen
- Small twigs and branches shaped for dead wood
- Sand and soil for realistic ground texture

### Scenery Development
The woodland environment was built in layers:
- Contoured terrain base with multiple elevation levels
- Forest floor with leaf litter and ground cover
- Strategic placement of trees and vegetation
- Natural-looking pathways and clearings
- Integration of the cabin into the landscape

### Weathering and Finishing
Careful attention to aging and weathering effects:
- Wood grain enhancement on cabin logs
- Moss and lichen growth on north-facing surfaces
- Dirt and mud splash on lower cabin walls
- Faded and worn roof shingles
- Natural color variation in vegetation

## Learning Experience

This project taught valuable lessons in:
- Working with natural materials and their preservation
- Creating realistic wood textures at scale
- Building terrain with multiple elevation levels
- Plant preparation and arrangement techniques
- Integrating structures naturally into landscape settings

The scratch-built approach allowed for complete creative control while presenting challenges in maintaining consistency and scale accuracy throughout the long build process.

## Display

The completed diorama measures approximately 30cm x 25cm and is displayed under a protective case. The natural materials have been sealed to prevent deterioration while maintaining their organic appearance.
