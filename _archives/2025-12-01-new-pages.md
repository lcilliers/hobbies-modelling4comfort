## What You Can Do Now

### 1. Add Build Log Entries

Create new files in the `_builds/` folder following this naming pattern:
- `german-sail-boat-001.md`
- `german-sail-boat-002.md`
- etc.

Use the template provided in the builds.md page. The front matter should look like:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "German Sail Boat - Build Log #001"
date: 2025-12-01
project: german-sail-boat
tags: [ships, planning, kit-review]
---
```

### 2. Add Technique Tutorials

Create new files in the `_techniques/` folder:
- `rigging.md`
- `water-effects.md`
- `weathering-aging.md`
- etc.

Follow the structure outlined in techniques.md with sections for:
- Overview
- Materials & Tools
- Step-by-Step Process
- Tips & Tricks
- Common Mistakes
- Project Examples

### 3. Customize the About Page

Edit `about.md` to add:
- Your real name (currently says "Your Name" in places)
- More personal details about your modeling journey
- Specific details about your workspace
- Your actual location if you want to share it
- Contact preferences

### 4. Update Projects

The builds.md and techniques.md pages reference several projects:
- Ancient Forest
- SS Great Britain
- Sea Rescue
- Riverside Cabin
- And others

Create pages for these in `_projects/` folder using `german-sail-boat.md` as a template.

## Publishing Workflow

As always, use your 3-step process:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your description of changes"
git push
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Actions to deploy.

See **PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions.

## Content Strategy Suggestions

### Build Logs
- Start with German Sail Boat since it's your most complete project
- Document each major phase: hull prep, deck work, rigging, painting, weathering
- Include at least 3-5 photos per build log
- Be honest about challenges and mistakes - they're valuable!
- Update regularly (weekly or bi-weekly during active builds)

### Techniques
- Prioritize techniques you use most often
- Start with simpler techniques (weathering basics) before advanced ones
- Use your actual project photos as examples
- Include "what not to do" sections - mistakes teach!
- Cross-reference to build logs where technique was used

### Projects
- Focus on completing pages for projects with most photos
- Ancient Forest, SS Great Britain, Sea Rescue look promising
- Each project page should have:
  - At least 3-5 good photos
  - Brief description and story
  - List of techniques used (link to technique pages)
  - Current status
  - Materials/tools used

## Next Steps

1. **Review the new pages** on your live site (wait 2-3 minutes for deployment)
2. **Start with one build log** - Document your next session on the German Sail Boat
3. **Add one technique tutorial** - Perhaps "Rigging Basics" since you're working on the boat
4. **Customize the About page** - Make it more personal
5. **Add photos for future content** - Use your `copy-project-images.ps1` and `imagemagick-optimize.ps1` scripts
