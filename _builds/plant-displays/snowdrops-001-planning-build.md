## Project Overview

Snowdrops are among the first flowers of spring, featuring delicate white drooping blooms. This display captures the ethereal beauty of these early bloomers through detailed handcrafted components.

## Current Status: In Progress

Components planned:
- Delicate white flower petals (paper construction)
- Carved bulb showing structure
- Root system detail
- Multiple growth stages from emerging shoot to full bloom

## Planning Work

Extensive planning has been documented showing design concepts, material selection, and construction approaches for capturing the delicate nature of snowdrop flowers.

## Build Progress

Construction work is underway on various components, with focus on achieving the characteristic drooping flower form and translucent petal appearance.

## Gallery

Current progress images show the development of individual components and early assembly experiments.
