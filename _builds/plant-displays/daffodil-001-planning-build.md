## Project Overview

The daffodil display is part of the ongoing Plant Displays Series, featuring this classic spring bulb (*Narcissus*) with its distinctive bright yellow trumpet flowers. This build log documents the planning, material collection, and construction progress for creating a comprehensive botanical display.

## Current Status

**In Progress** - Research and material collection phase (20 planning images, 6 build photos documented)

The daffodil display will include:
- **Carved wood bulb** showing internal structure and layers
- **Leaf models** (pressed specimens and scratch-built linear leaves)
- **Trumpet flower construction** (paper/clay techniques for corona and perianth)
- **Root system** carved from wood
- **Seasonal growth stages** showing emergence through flowering

## Why Daffodil?

The daffodil holds special significance as:
- Classic spring herald with cheerful yellow blooms
- Personal garden favorite with annual appearance
- Interesting bulb structure for cross-section display
- Distinctive trumpet flower shape offering construction challenges
- Cultural and poetic significance (Wordsworth's "host of golden daffodils")

## Planning & Research Phase

### Planning Images (20 photos)

The extensive planning documentation covers:
- Reference photos of daffodils at various growth stages
- Bulb cross-section research and design
- Trumpet flower petal structure analysis
- Leaf growth pattern studies
- Material sample testing

### Design Challenges

**Bulb Construction:**
- Creating layered structure visible in cross-section
- Carving concentric layers without splitting wood
- Showing papery brown exterior and white fleshy interior

**Trumpet Flower:**
- Distinctive corona (trumpet) extending from perianth (petals)
- Achieving delicate flared edge of trumpet
- Six petals arranged symmetrically
- Bright yellow color accuracy

**Linear Leaves:**
- Long, narrow, bluish-green leaves
- Showing natural curve and growth pattern
- Pressed specimens vs scratch-built comparison

## Construction Progress

## Techniques Being Explored

### Wood Carving for Bulb
- Selecting appropriate wood grain for layered effect
- Carving tools for detailed interior structure
- Finishing techniques to show different tissue types

### Paper/Clay Flower Construction
- Creating trumpet shape with proper flare
- Attaching corona to perianth seamlessly
- Painting techniques for yellow gradations

### Leaf Modeling
- Pressing actual daffodil leaves for comparison
- Scratch-building linear leaves with natural curve
- Resin casting possibilities for preservation

## Materials Collected

- Reference photographs (spring daffodils in bloom)
- Wood blanks for bulb carving
- Pressed daffodil leaves (spring collection)
- Yellow paper samples for flower construction
- Clay samples for petal experiments

## Next Steps

1. **Seasonal Material Collection** - Continue gathering pressed specimens through spring bloom
2. **Bulb Carving** - Complete wood-carved bulb cross-section
3. **Flower Construction** - Prototype trumpet techniques in paper and clay
4. **Root System** - Design and carve root structure
5. **Board Layout** - Plan arrangement of all components
6. **Identification Plate** - Design etched plate with details

## Timeline

This display will progress through multiple seasons:
- **Spring:** Collect pressed flowers and leaves at peak
- **Summer/Fall:** Construction of carved and modeled components
- **Winter:** Assembly and board layout work
- **Ongoing:** Refinement and documentation
