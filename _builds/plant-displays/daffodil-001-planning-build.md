## Project Overview

The daffodil display is part of the ongoing Plant Displays Series, featuring this classic spring bulb with its distinctive bright yellow blooms. This build log documents the planning, material collection, and construction progress for creating a comprehensive botanical display.

## Current Status

**In Progress** - Research and material collection phase

The daffodil display will include:
- Carved wood bulb showing internal structure
- Leaf models (pressed specimens and scratch-built)
- Flower construction (paper/clay techniques)
- Root system representation
- Seasonal growth stages
