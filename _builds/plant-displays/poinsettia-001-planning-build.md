## Project Overview

Poinsettia is the quintessential Christmas plant, featuring distinctive red bracts (modified leaves) arranged in a star pattern around small yellow flowers. This display celebrates this seasonal favorite with its dramatic coloring and geometric form.

## Current Status: Planning & Early Construction

The poinsettia display will include:
- Large red bracts in characteristic star arrangement
- Central cluster of small yellow true flowers
- Green foliage leaves below bracts
- Plant structure and growth form

## Planning Phase

## Design Considerations

Key aspects being addressed:
- Vibrant red color of bracts
- Star-shaped arrangement and geometry
- Distinction between bracts and true leaves
- Scale appropriate for display board

## Construction Approach

Working on techniques for:
- Creating pointed, oval bract shapes
- Achieving rich red coloring
- Arranging bracts in natural star pattern
- Small central flower cluster detail
