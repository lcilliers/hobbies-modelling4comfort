## Project Overview

Protea flowers are among the most dramatic and structurally unique blooms, featuring large, textured bracts surrounding a dense central cone. This South African native presents significant construction challenges due to its size and complex structure.

## Current Status: Early Planning

The protea display requires special consideration:
- **Large flower size** may require custom board dimensions
- **Complex petal/bract structure** with distinctive textures
- **Unique central cone** with densely packed florets
- **Substantial leaf forms**

## Planning Phase

### Planning Images (4 photos)

Research and design work addressing the challenges of representing this large, complex flower at display scale. Material selection is critical for achieving the characteristic texture.

## Construction Challenges

The protea presents unique difficulties:
- Size of flower relative to standard display boards
- Capturing the fuzzy, textured quality of bracts
- Central cone detail and structure
- Weight considerations for large components
