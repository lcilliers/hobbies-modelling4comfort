## Project Overview

Bluebells are quintessential British woodland flowers, featuring graceful drooping bell-shaped blooms in distinctive blue-violet color. This display captures the essence of spring woodland carpet created by massed bluebells.

## Current Status: In Progress

The bluebell display includes:
- Multiple bell-shaped flowers on arching stems
- Characteristic drooping posture
- Woodland bulb and root system
- Potential for situational diorama showing woodland setting

## Construction Focus

Key challenges include:
- Achieving the delicate drooping form of individual bells
- Creating multiple flowers at appropriate scale
- Capturing the distinctive blue-violet color
- Representing the massed effect of woodland bluebells
