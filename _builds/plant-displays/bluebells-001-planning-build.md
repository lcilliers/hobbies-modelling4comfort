## Project Overview

Bluebells are quintessential British woodland flowers, featuring graceful drooping bell-shaped blooms in distinctive blue-violet color. This display captures the essence of spring woodland carpet created by massed bluebells.  The displays focus on tow different types: The english bluebell and spanish bluebell, and then also included muscari as they often are seen together.

## Current Status: In Progress

The bluebell display includes:
- Multiple bell-shaped flowers on arching stems with characteristic drooping posture (Englsih Bluebell)
- Multiple bell-shaped flowers with shorter tubes and shaped around the stem (spanish bluebell)
- Small flowers, bead-like shaped like a bunch of grapes (muscari)
- Woodland bulbs of all three types 
- Displayed as a situational diorama showing woodland setting

## Planning & Research Phase

### Flowers

The English Bluebell are narrow, tubular, and strongly curve at the tips. They mostly hang off on one side of the stem with a graceful loop.  The Spanish Bluebell flowers are wider and more open, less tubular.  They also grow all around the stem, looking upright and less drooping. Muscari flowers are small, urn-shaped or bead-like, clustered tightly around the stem like a bunch of grapes.

*Muscari characteristics: small urn-shaped bead-like flowers, tightly clustered like grapes*


### Blubs

The bulb for all three are distinctly different.  Muscari bulbs are small and oval to teardrop in shape. it is compact with fleshy scales and a basal plate.  English Bluebell bulbs are elongated, slightly tapered at one end. It also has fleshy scales, storing energy for the next season.  The Spannish Bluebell bulb is similar to the english bluebell but the bulbs are slightly rounder and bulkier.

## Construction Focus

Key challenges include:
- Achieving the delicate drooping form of individual bells
- Creating multiple flowers at appropriate scale
- Capturing the distinctive blue-violet color
- Representing the massed effect of woodland bluebells

*Bluebells offer the opportunity to create a more contextual display showing the plant in its natural woodland habitat setting.*
