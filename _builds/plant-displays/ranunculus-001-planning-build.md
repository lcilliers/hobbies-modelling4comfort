## Project Overview

Ranunculus flowers feature stunning, densely layered petals creating a rose-like appearance with depth and texture. The multiple thin petal layers present significant construction challenges at miniature scale.

## Current Status: Active Construction

This is one of the more advanced builds in the collection, with extensive planning documentation showing:
- Petal layer construction techniques
- Color and texture approaches
- Assembly methods for dense petal arrangements
- Multiple test pieces and experiments

## Construction Challenges

Ranunculus presents unique difficulties:
- **Petal count**: Dozens of thin, delicate petals per flower
- **Layering complexity**: Overlapping petals create depth
- **Delicate structure**: Individual petals must be thin but strong enough to handle
- **Center detail**: Tight central bud structure

## Planning & Research Phase

### Planning Images 

The most extensively documented plant in the series, with comprehensive planning showing:
- Detailed petal layer analysis
- Multiple construction technique experiments
- Color and texture material testing
- Assembly method development
