## Project Overview

Ranunculus flowers feature stunning, densely layered petals creating a rose-like appearance with exceptional depth and texture. The multiple thin petal layers present significant construction challenges at miniature scale.

## Current Status: Active Construction

This is one of the more advanced builds in the collection, with extensive planning documentation showing:
- Petal layer construction techniques
- Color and texture approaches
- Assembly methods for dense petal arrangements
- Multiple test pieces and experiments

## Construction Challenges

Ranunculus presents unique difficulties:
- **Petal count**: Dozens of thin, delicate petals per flower
- **Layering complexity**: Overlapping petals create depth
- **Delicate structure**: Individual petals must be thin but strong enough to handle
- **Center detail**: Tight central bud structure

## Planning Work

Significant planning effort has gone into this plant, with 44 planning images documenting various approaches, material tests, and construction experiments.

## Build Progress

Active construction work includes petal formation experiments, assembly technique development, and color testing.

*The ranunculus represents one of the most technically challenging flowers in the collection due to its complex petal structure. Extensive experimentation is guiding the construction approach.*
