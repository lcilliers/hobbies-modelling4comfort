## Project Overview

Strelitzia, commonly known as Bird of Paradise, is an exotic tropical flower with a distinctive bird-like appearance. The flower emerges from a boat-shaped bract with brilliant orange and blue petals arranged in a characteristic fan formation.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

This striking plant requires careful planning for:
- The unique boat-shaped bract (spathe)
- Orange sepals and blue petals arranged like a bird's crest
- Large, paddle-shaped tropical leaves
- Complex color combinations (orange, blue, green)

## Planning Phase

## Design Challenges

The bird of paradise presents interesting construction challenges:
- Capturing the three-dimensional flower structure
- Achieving the distinctive color contrasts
- Representing the substantial leaf forms
- Balance between flower drama and overall board composition
