## Build Log 002: Building the Eriba Triton Caravan

**Date:** December 22, 2024 - January 15, 2025  
**Phase:** Caravan Construction  
**Time Spent:** ~25 hours  
**Status:** Completed (after multiple rework cycles)

---

### The Moment of Truth

With planning complete and materials assembled, it was time to tackle the caravan - the centerpiece of this commission and the component I'd never attempted anything like before.

**My reasoning for starting here:**  
If I couldn't successfully build a recognizable miniature caravan, there was no point continuing with the rest of the project. Better to fail fast on the hardest component than invest 50+ hours only to discover I couldn't deliver what was promised.

This wasn't just any caravan - this was *their* caravan. The Eriba Triton. It needed to be recognizable.

### Phase 1: Body Construction - Balsa Layers

</figure>

**Construction Method:**
1. **Base Layers:** Cut three layers of balsa wood for the body shell
2. **Height Spacing:** Added balsa spacers between layers to achieve:
   - Floor to center line height
   - Center line to roof height
3. **Initial Assembly:** Glued layers with spacers to create hollow shell

**Why this approach?**  
- Balsa is light and easy to carve
- Hollow construction saves weight
- Provides structure for epoxy putty application
- Creates internal space (even though not visible)

The characteristic "egg" shape of the Eriba couldn't be achieved with flat balsa alone - the compound curves required a different approach.

### Phase 2: Shaping with Milliput Epoxy Putty

**The Challenge:** Creating smooth, compound curves

Milliput two-part epoxy putty becomes the solution - and the challenge:

**Advantages:**
- Can be shaped and carved when fresh
- Hardens to a solid, stable surface
- Can be sanded smooth when fully cured
- Accepts paint well

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited working time (~60-90 minutes)
- Difficult to achieve perfectly smooth application
- Requires experience to work effectively
- Each layer needs full cure before next application

**My Process:**
1. **Mixed small batches** - working within the time window
2. **Applied in sections** - front, sides, rear, top separately
3. **Rough shaped** while still workable with wet tools
4. **Allowed 24 hours cure** between sessions
5. **Sanded extensively** with progressively finer grits
6. **Repeated** - multiple layers to build up smooth curves

As visible in the photo, **I had to make several adjustments to get the angles representative of the real Eriba.** The characteristic curve from floor to roof, the distinctive front nose, the gentle taper toward the rear - each required careful observation and patient refinement.

**Lesson Learned:** Automotive curves in miniature are HARD. What looks like a simple curve is actually a compound curve changing in multiple directions. I gained immense respect for model car kit designers.

### Phase 3: Windows - The Fiddly Details

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/caravaning/caravan/caravaning-caravan-004.jpg" alt="Windows and wheels">
  <figcaption>Windows cut from hardwood as templates for wire frames; wheels from layered bamboo with paper tire treads</figcaption>
</figure>

**Window Construction Process:**

**1. Templates (Hardwood):**
- Cut window shapes from thin hardwood
- Used for visual checking against reference photos
- Served as bending forms for wire frames
- Allowed testing positioning before commitment

**2. Outer Frames (1.5mm aluminum wire):**
- Black-coated wire bent to match template shapes
- Corners carefully formed to match Eriba's rounded window corners
- Each window required multiple attempts to get curves right
- Wire wants to spring back - needed to overbend slightly

**3. Inner Frames (0.5mm aluminum wire):**
- Added inside outer frames for detail
- Represents the actual window frame dividers
- Glued carefully to maintain alignment
- Extremely fiddly at this scale

**4. Glazing (Transparent Plastic):**
- Cut from clear packaging material
- Slightly oversize, then trimmed after gluing
- Attached to inside of wire frames
- CA glue applied carefully to avoid clouding plastic

**5. Curtains (Painted Tissue Paper):**
- Tissue paper for proper drape appearance
- Painted before cutting (easier than painting after)
- Mixed colors for different rooms
- Glued behind glazing to show through windows

**The Nose Windows:** The front curved nose windows were particularly challenging. The compound curve of the Eriba's nose means the windows aren't just curved - they're curved in two directions. Getting wire to hold this shape while maintaining the glazing attachment was frustrating. I rebuilt these windows three times before achieving acceptable results.

### Phase 4: Wheels and Running Gear

Still visible in the same photo - the wheel construction:

**Wheel Building Method:**
1. **Hub:** Small bamboo disc (center)
2. **Rim:** Larger bamboo ring (outer)
3. **Spoke Effect:** Middle layer with wedges cut out
4. **Assembly:** Three layers glued concentrically
5. **Tires:** Black paper strip wrapped around rim
6. **Axle:** Wire rod connecting both wheels

**Why bamboo?**  
- Strong for its weight
- Easy to cut cleanly with sharp blade
- Natural grain adds subtle texture
- Readily available (skewers and placemats)

The wheels needed to look correct for an Eriba - not too sporty, not too industrial. The real caravan has distinctive alloy wheels with a simple spoke pattern. My bamboo construction captured this reasonably well.

### Phase 5: Additional Details

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/caravaning/caravan/caravaning-caravan-006.jpg" alt="Details added">
  <figcaption>Mudguards, bumper, lights, and roof fitted - all windows now in place</figcaption>
</figure>

**Components Added:**

**Mudguards (Wheel Covers):**
- Formed from epoxy putty
- Shaped to follow wheel curve
- Sanded smooth
- Painted to match body

**Rear Bumper:**
- Epoxy putty shaped to Eriba profile
- Includes mounting points detail
- Chrome-painted highlights

**Rear Lights:**
- Tiny epoxy putty shapes
- Red and amber paint
- Clear gloss coat for lens effect

**Roof:**
- Cut from balsa sheet
- Sanded to achieve gentle curve
- Edge detail added
- Painted separately before attachment

At this stage, with all windows installed and major components fitted, the caravan was starting to look recognizable. But the paint finish wasn't right...

### The Painting Disaster

<figure>

  <figcaption>After several failed paint attempts: windows ripped off, body sanded back to base</figcaption>
</figure>

**What Went Wrong:**

After several attempts to paint and smooth the body, I could see it wasn't good enough:
- Paint showing epoxy putty application lines
- Uneven surface texture visible in certain light
- Orange peel effect from rushed painting
- Imperfections I could see would bother me forever

**The Difficult Decision:**

This was a commissioned piece. It needed to be right. "Good enough" wasn't good enough.

I made the call: **rip off all the windows and start the finishing process again.**

**The Rework Process:**
1. **Carefully removed all windows** - tried to save them (partially successful)
2. **Sanded the entire body** down to near-base level
3. **Applied thin layer of epoxy putty** to fill remaining imperfections
4. **Extensive sanding** with 240, 400, 600, 800 grit progression
5. **Primer coat** to check for remaining issues
6. **More sanding** where needed
7. **Final primer coat**
8. **Patient base coat** application - thin layers, drying between
9. **Color coats** - multiple thin layers
10. **Clear coat** for protection

**Time invested in paint rework:** About 8 hours spread over multiple days

**Emotional cost:** Significant. Questioning abilities. Wondering if I should have just accepted the first attempt.

**Was it worth it?** Absolutely. The final finish was smooth, even, and professional-looking.

**Lesson:** In commissioned work, your standards matter more than your timeline. The client is trusting you with their memories.

  </figure>
</div>

**Final Components:**

**Jockey Wheel (Front Support):**
- Wire frame construction
- Tiny wheel that actually rotates
- Mounting bracket detail
- Simulated adjustment mechanism

**Brake Assembly:**
- Small box on A-frame
- Represents handbrake unit
- Cable detail to chassis
- Painted industrial grey

**Tow Hitch:**
- Ball hitch socket
- Mounting points
- Safety chain attachments
- Breakaway cable detail

**The Moment:** Stepping back and seeing the completed caravan was a triumph. All the frustration, the rework, the failed attempts - worth it. This actually looked like an Eriba Triton. Not perfect, but recognizable, well-proportioned, and convincingly detailed.

**Proof of Concept:** If I could build this caravan, I could build the car. The commission was feasible.

### Reflections

**What Worked Well:**
- Balsa/epoxy putty combination for body
- Window construction method
- Bamboo wheels
- Decision to rework rather than accept flawed finish

**What Was Challenging:**
- Achieving smooth compound curves
- Front nose window curves
- Paint application without texture
- Managing epoxy putty working time
- Accepting time cost of doing it right

**What I'd Do Differently:**
- Apply thinner layers of epoxy putty initially (easier to sand)
- Build more cure time into schedule (less rushing)
- Practice paint technique on scrap before final piece
- Create more detailed window templates first

**The Validation:** When I showed my son the completed caravan, his immediate response: "That's our caravan!" Mission accomplished. The hours of work, the frustration, the rework - all justified by that recognition.

### Next Steps

With the caravan successfully completed, confidence was high. Time to tackle the next major challenge: the VW Golf R Estate.

The lessons learned here - particularly about accepting rework and the importance of patient finishing - would prove crucial for the car build.
