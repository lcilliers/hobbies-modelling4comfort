## Build Log 007: Final Assembly, Finishing, and Delivery

**Date:** April 20 - May 10, 2025  
**Phase:** Final Integration and Delivery  
**Time Spent:** ~12 hours  
**Status:** Completed and Delivered

---

### The Final Countdown

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/caravaning/gallery/caravaning-gallery-018.jpg" alt="Components ready">
  <figcaption>All components complete and ready for final integration</figcaption>
</figure>

After months of construction, all the individual elements were complete:

- ✅ Eriba Triton caravan
- ✅ VW Golf R Estate
- ✅ Two human figures
- ✅ Tilly the dog
- ✅ Trees and vegetation
- ✅ Rocky riverbank
- ✅ Static grass coverage
- ✅ Resin water river

Now came the nerve-wracking task: permanently assembling everything together.

**The anxiety:** Up until this point, components were moveable. I could adjust, reposition, rework. Once glued down, everything became permanent. No more chances to fix mistakes.

**The necessity:** For delivery, the diorama needed to be stable, transportable, and durable. Components needed secure mounting.

    <figcaption>Test fitting all elements - checking sight lines and composition</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Composition Considerations:**

1. **Caravan Positioning:**
   - Slightly off-center (more dynamic)
   - Angled ~15° (shows side and front)
   - Door visible toward viewer
   - Relationship to car and figures clear

2. **Car Placement:**
   - Behind caravan (towing position)
   - Visible from front/side (shows it's an estate)
   - Hitch connection implied
   - License plate visible

3. **Figure Positions:**
   - Male figure: Near car (owner checking vehicle)
   - Female figure: Near caravan (setup/pack activity)
   - Both at natural heights (standing on grass)
   - Positioned so they "read" together

4. **Tilly Placement:**
   - Exploring away from figures (dog behavior)
   - Near water (dogs love water)
   - Visible and clear focal point herself
   - Adds life and story

5. **Sight Lines:**
   - No element completely hidden behind another
   - Viewer can see all key details
   - Depth and overlapping (but not obscuring)
   - Works from multiple viewing angles

**Testing:** Spent several hours just moving components around, stepping back, viewing from different angles, taking photos, adjusting.

**Strategy:** Once satisfied, marked positions with pencil on base before removing components for gluing.

---

### Mounting the Trees

Trees went down first - they establish the scene edges and frame.

**Tree Mounting Process:**

1. **Pilot Holes:**
   - Drilled small holes in base where tree trunks would go
   - Depth: ~10mm (secure mounting)
   - Diameter: Slightly smaller than trunk wire

2. **Trunk Preparation:**
   - Trimmed tree base to clean wire
   - Bent slightly if needed (natural lean)
   - Test fit in holes

3. **Adhesive:**
   - Epoxy glue in holes (strongest bond)
   - Inserted tree trunks
   - Held vertical while checking from multiple angles
   - Left to cure (24 hours)

4. **Base Blending:**
   - Once cured, built up ground texture around base
   - PVA and scatter material
   - Moss and small plants at tree bases
   - Static grass integration
   - Natural transition (trees grow from ground, not sit on it)

**Result:** Six trees securely mounted, framing the scene, creating depth.

  <figcaption>Mounting vehicles - making sure they sit naturally on the grass</figcaption>
</figure>

**Caravan Mounting:**

1. **Base Contact:**
   - Caravan has wheels and stabilizing legs
   - All contact points marked on base
   - Small indents made for wheels (sitting IN grass, not on top)

2. **Adhesive Strategy:**
   - Superglue on wheel contact points (instant, strong)
   - PVA around edges (cleanup friendly)
   - Wheels slightly sunk into grass (realistic weight)

3. **Level Check:**
   - Spirit level confirmed caravan sits straight
   - Slight nose-up angle (realistic when hitched)
   - Door clearance (opens visually, even though fixed)

4. **Integration:**
   - Built up grass around wheels
   - Shadows painted under caravan (depth)
   - Connection to ground looks natural

**Car Mounting:**

1. **Tire Tracks:**
   - Visible path where car drove onto grass
   - Compressed grass (darker, flatter)
   - Slight dirt/mud visible in tracks
   - Adds realism and story

2. **Wheel Position:**
   - Each wheel slightly sunk into grass
   - Tire tread impression suggested
   - Weight distributed realistically

3. **Adhesive:**
   - Epoxy under each wheel (stronger than superglue for potential bumps)
   - Clamped gently while curing
   - Double-checked level from all angles

4. **Hitch Connection:**
   - Fine wire connecting car to caravan
   - Painted to match (subtle)
   - Shows relationship between vehicles

**Result:** Both vehicles sit convincingly on the ground, looking like they have weight and belong in the scene.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/caravaning/gallery/caravaning-gallery-005.jpg" alt="Tilly positioned">
    <figcaption>Tilly exploring near the water - the star of the show</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Human Figures:**

1. **Foot Position:**
   - Figures carved with flat feet
   - Standing naturally on grass
   - Slight depressions suggested where feet compress grass
   - Stable stance

2. **Relationship to Elements:**
   - Male figure near car (checking, loading, owner role)
   - Female figure near caravan (setup, domestic role)
   - Both facing slightly toward each other (connection)
   - Natural positions (not posed, just being)

3. **Mounting:**
   - Small pins in feet (drilled, epoxy glued)
   - Holes in base for pins
   - Secure mounting
   - Can't be knocked over easily

4. **Shadows:**
   - Painted shadows at feet (grounds figures)
   - Direction matches trees and vehicles
   - Subtle but effective depth cue

**Tilly the Dog:**

1. **Position:**
   - Investigating near riverbank
   - Head toward water (dog curiosity)
   - Distance from owners (dogs explore)
   - Clear sightline (she's small, needs visibility)

2. **Mounting:**
   - All four paws contact ground
   - Pinned securely (smallest, most delicate component)
   - Natural stance (alert, exploring)

3. **The Story Moment:**
   - Couple has stopped at riverside
   - Car and caravan parked
   - They're doing setup/checking vehicle
   - Tilly is investigating interesting smells near water
   - Peaceful Welsh countryside moment

**Result:** The figures bring life to the scene. Without them, it's a pretty diorama. With them, it's a story.

**The Handover:**

Met my son and his partner at their home. Nervous excitement - seven months of work about to be judged.

**Unpacking:**
- Removed protective case first
- Their immediate reaction: silence (nerve-wracking)
- Then: "Oh my god, that's incredible!"

**Their Observations:**
- "That's definitely our car - you even got the number plate!"
- "The caravan looks just like the photos we showed you!"
- "Is that... is that supposed to be Tilly? That's amazing! Look at her ears!"
- "I love the river - it actually looks wet!"
- "The grass looks so real - I can see where you'd pitch the tent!"
- "This is going in the living room. Everyone has to see this."

**Questions Asked:**
- How long did it take? (80 hours over 7 months)
- What's it made of? (Everything from scratch - explained materials)
- How did you make the water? (Explained resin technique)
- Can we touch it? (Yes, but carefully - showed how to lift protective case)
- Did you enjoy making it? (Mixed answer - stressful but rewarding)

**Their Reaction to Tilly:**
"You made her perfect. The ears are exactly right. When we show people this, they're going to recognize her immediately."

**Payment and Completion:**

- Commission fee agreed upon (£250 - covering materials and time)
- Payment received
- Handshake and thanks
- Photos taken of them with the diorama
- Promised to share photos of it in their home

**My Feelings:**
- Relief (they loved it)
- Pride (it turned out well)
- Exhaustion (seven months of effort)
- Satisfaction (commissioned work completed successfully)
- Slight sadness (letting go of major project)

---

### Reflections on Commissioned Work

**What's Different About Commissioned vs. Personal Projects:**

**Commissioned Work:**
- ❌ Less creative freedom (must match brief)
- ✅ Higher standards required (someone paid for it)
- ❌ More pressure (can't just abandon if difficult)
- ✅ Clear goals (specific requirements)
- ❌ Less fun when frustrated (can't just put aside)
- ✅ Accountability (someone expects results)
- ✅ Professional development (portfolio piece)
- ✅ Financial compensation (small, but there)

**Personal Projects:**
- ✅ Total creative freedom
- ❌ Can abandon when difficult
- ✅ Fun-focused
- ❌ Easier to accept "good enough"
- ✅ No pressure
- ❌ No external accountability
- ❌ No portfolio pressure

**What I Learned:**
- I can deliver commissioned work to professional standards
- My skills are marketable (if I chose to pursue this)
- I enjoy the challenge of constraints
- Meeting client expectations is very satisfying
- Being accountable raises my own standards

**Would I Do Commissioned Work Again?**

Yes, but selectively:
- Projects that interest me technically
- Clients I trust and communicate well with
- Reasonable timelines
- Fair compensation for time and materials
- Subjects I'm passionate about

---

### The Technical Challenges Conquered

**Major Hurdles Overcome:**

1. **Eriba Caravan Curves** ✅
   - Problem: Complex compound curves
   - Solution: Balsa wood + epoxy putty + patience

2. **VW Golf Estate (Wrong Reference Model)** ✅
   - Problem: Only had sedan, needed estate
   - Solution: Air-dry clay, photo references, multiple reworks

3. **Recognizable Figures at 1:42** ✅
   - Problem: Too small for portrait detail
   - Solution: Stylized wood carving, characteristic postures

4. **Tilly the Dog** ✅
   - Problem: Tiny scale, must be recognizable
   - Solution: Wood carving (material breakthrough)

5. **Space Constraints** ✅
   - Problem: Entire scene in 350mm x 250mm
   - Solution: Careful composition, suggestion over completion

6. **Realistic Water** ✅
   - Problem: Making water actually look wet
   - Solution: Epoxy resin (nerve-wracking but successful)

7. **Natural Grass Coverage** ✅
   - Problem: Avoiding "astroturf" appearance
   - Solution: Multiple colors/heights, campsite research

**None of these were guaranteed to work. All required research, testing, and accepting failure as part of the learning process.**

---

### What I Would Do Differently

**If I Were Starting This Project Again:**

1. **More Time for Planning:**
   - Spent 8 hours planning
   - Should have spent 15-20 hours
   - Better planning = less rework

2. **Test Pieces for Every Technique:**
   - Did some testing
   - Should have tested EVERYTHING
   - Would have saved rework time

3. **Better Progress Photos:**
   - Got caught up in building, forgot to document
   - Missing some key progress shots
   - Would establish photo routine

4. **Earlier Client Check-ins:**
   - Showed progress a few times
   - Should have shown more frequent updates
   - Prevents surprises at delivery

5. **More Realistic Timeline:**
   - Estimated 3 months
   - Took 5 months
   - Should have built in buffer time

6. **Charge More:**
   - £250 for 80 hours = £3.12/hour
   - Should have charged £400-500 minimum
   - Undervalued time and skill

**But Would I Change the Process?**
- The struggles taught me
- The rework improved skills
- The challenges made me better
- The project achieved its goals

No regrets.

### Final Thoughts

This project pushed me further than any previous model building work. It demanded new skills, tested my patience, and required professional-level results.

**What Made It Worthwhile:**
- Seeing the clients' faces when they recognized their car, their dog, themselves
- Knowing it will be displayed and enjoyed for years
- Having a portfolio piece that demonstrates serious skills
- Proving to myself I can complete commissioned work
- The growth as a builder and artist

**The Biggest Lesson:**

Commissioned work isn't just about building skill. It's about:
- Communication
- Meeting expectations
- Professional standards
- Accountability
- Delivering on promises
- Client satisfaction
- Personal integrity

I started this project as a favor for my son. I finished it as a professional commission that I'm genuinely proud of.

**The Questions I Can Now Answer:**

- Can I build vehicles from scratch? **Yes.**
- Can I work with multiple materials and techniques? **Yes.**
- Can I deliver commissioned work? **Yes.**
- Can I meet client expectations? **Yes.**
- Would I do it again? **Yes, selectively.**

**The Question I Couldn't Answer Before:**

Am I good enough to charge for my work?

**The Answer:**

Not yet at full professional rates, but yes - I can deliver commissioned work that clients value and love. This project proved that.

---

### What's Next?

**Immediate Plans:**
- Rest (seriously, I need a break from detailed work)
- Document lessons learned more formally
- Update portfolio with this project
- Consider next commission (if right project presents itself)

**Future Goals:**
- Improve figure sculpting (still weakest skill)
- Master automotive paint finishes
- Explore other scales
- Try different types of commissions
- Potentially teach workshops (passing on skills)

**This Project Opened Doors:**

Word of mouth has already generated interest from friends and family. "Could you make...?" questions are appearing.

I now know the answer: "Maybe. Let's talk about what you're envisioning."
