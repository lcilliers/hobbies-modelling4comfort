## Build Log 001: Planning Phase and Commission Brief

**Date:** December 15, 2024  
**Phase:** Project Planning and Research  
**Time Spent:** ~8 hours  
**Status:** Planning Complete

---

### The Commission

It started casually over a relaxing evening with my son and his family in November 2024. Fresh from completing the English Country Garden, I was feeling confident - perhaps overconfident.

"So do you have anything that I can build for you?" I asked jokingly.

"Yes!" came the immediate response. "Can you build our new caravan and car on a campsite next to a river?"

And just like that, I had a commission.

**Client Requirements:**
- Eriba Triton caravan (their actual model)
- VW Golf R Estate in red (their actual car)
- Two figures (my son and daughter-in-law)
- Tilly (their beloved dog)
- Campsite setting near a river
- Welsh countryside scenery
- Must fit on 25cm × 25cm base (shelf space constraint)

### Reality Check: What I'd Never Done Before

As the excitement settled, reality set in. This commission required skills I didn't have:

**Vehicle Modeling:** Zero experience
- Never built a miniature car or caravan
- No idea how to achieve smooth automotive curves
- Uncertain about materials and techniques

**Portrait Figures:** Previous failures
- My figure work was poor and not recognizable
- Never successfully sculpted specific people
- Concerned about client disappointment

**Animals:** Complete unknown
- Never attempted a miniature dog
- No reference for techniques
- Tilly needed to be recognizable

**Water Effects:** Previous attempt unsatisfactory
- Log Cabin river was disappointing
- Needed to research better techniques
- Resin work was new territory

Despite these challenges, I accepted the commission. The only way to improve is to push beyond comfort zones.

### Scale Determination

With a fixed 25cm × 25cm base (dictated by available shelf space), I needed to work backwards from the caravan dimensions to determine the scale.

#### Research Phase

  </figure>
</div>

I collected extensive reference material:
- **Manufacturer Specs:** Official Eriba Triton dimensions
- **Online Photos:** Multiple angles and detail shots
- **Other Models:** Found one example of someone's scratch-built Eriba
- **Site Visit:** Photographed the actual caravan and car on location

#### Scale Calculations

Working from the Eriba Triton's actual dimensions, everything calculated to **1:42 scale**.

**Caravan Dimensions (mm):**

| Element | Model | Actual | Ratio |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Body Length | 100mm | 4210mm | 1:42.1 |
| Overall Length | 125mm | 5280mm | 1:42.2 |
| Width | 48mm | 2000mm | 1:41.7 |
| Height | 54mm | 2260mm | 1:41.9 |

The slight variations average out to **1:42** - close enough for visual accuracy.

**Related Elements at 1:42:**

| Item | Model Size | Real Size | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Base | 250mm | 10.5m | Entire scene footprint |
| Man | 48mm | 2.0m | 6'6" figure |
| Woman | 40mm | 1.7m | 5'7" figure |
| Dog (Tilly) | 12mm | 500mm | Medium-sized dog |
| Car | 90mm | 3.8m | VW Golf Estate |
| Large Tree | 143mm | 6.0m | Background tree |
| River Width | 71mm | 3.0m | Backdrop river |
| Large Plant | 48mm | 2.0m | Tall shrub |
| Flower Head | 1mm | 40mm | Individual bloom |

This mathematical foundation gave me confidence - if I got the proportions right on paper, everything would look correct together.

<!-- NOTE: The 1:42 scale is unusual - most model cars are 1:43 (common die-cast scale) or 1:35/1:48 (military modeling). This means purchasing commercial vehicles wasn't an option. Everything had to be scratch-built to match the caravan scale. -->

### Creating Working Plans

  </figure>
</div>

Without formal architectural drawing skills, I work "to the eye" - measuring and fitting as I build. But for this commission, I needed more structure:

**Planning Documents Created:**
1. **Scale conversion table** for all elements
2. **Cutting sheet** for caravan body layers
3. **Reference photo collection** organized by component
4. **Materials list** for each build phase
5. **Angle calculations** from side-view photos

The cutting sheet became my blueprint. Even though I knew I'd adjust during construction, having these dimensions calculated in advance prevented major errors.

### Research - The Eriba Challenge

  <figcaption>Finding this scratch-built example proved it was possible!</figcaption>
</figure>

**Research Findings:**
- **No kits available** at any scale for Eriba caravans
- **No building plans** for model makers
- **Very few examples** of scratch-built Eribas
- **One successful build** found online (pictured above)

The one example I found was crucial - it proved someone else had successfully scratch-built an Eriba. If they could do it, so could I.

**Key Details to Capture:**
- Distinctive curved body shape (Eriba's signature "egg" profile)
- Large curved windows (particularly challenging front nose windows)
- Characteristic mudguards
- Jockey wheel and hitch
- Wheel design and proportions
- Rear bumper and lights

---

### Research - The VW Golf Estate

  </figure>
</div>

**Car Challenge:**
- No model kits at 1:42 scale for Golf Estate
- Purchased 1:43 VW Golf *sedan* as sizing reference
- Needed to modify proportions for estate body style
- Required understanding of automotive curves and details

**Key Details to Capture:**
- Estate roofline (longer than sedan)
- Rear hatch design
- Red paint finish
- Actual license plate number (for personal touch)
- Wheel design
- Light clusters
- Window proportions

---

### Build Strategy Decision

With all research complete, I faced a critical decision: **what to build first?**

**Decision:** Build the caravan first.

**Reasoning:**
- Most technically challenging component
- If I couldn't successfully build the caravan, there was no point continuing
- Would establish whether my techniques could achieve the required quality
- Learning curve on caravan would inform car build
- Failure early is better than failure late

This was a risk-management decision. Better to discover my limitations early than invest 50+ hours only to fail on the centerpiece component.

---

### Materials Planning

**Caravan Construction:**
- Balsa wood (body layers and roof)
- Milliput two-part epoxy putty (body shaping)
- 1.5mm aluminum wire (window frames)
- 0.5mm aluminum wire (inner window detail)
- Transparent plastic (window panes)
- Tissue paper (curtains)
- Bamboo (wheel construction)
- Paper (tire treads)
- Hot glue (detail work)

**Car Construction:**
- Air-dry clay (body shaping) - *new material to try*
- Balsa wood (internal structure)
- Plastic sheet (windows)
- Hot glue (lights)
- Paint (automotive red finish)

**Figures:**
- Wire (armatures)
- Air-dry clay - *easier to work than epoxy putty*
- Wood (Tilly the dog)
- Paint (flesh tones and clothing)

**Scenery:**
- Static grass - *new tool to try*
- Wire (trees and plant armatures)
- Paper (leaves and petals)
- Sawdust (tree foliage)
- Clear casting resin (river) - *improved technique needed*
- Paint and natural materials

<!-- NOTE: The decision to try air-dry clay was based on frustration with epoxy putty's short working time. Air-dry clay allows longer shaping and smoothing time before it hardens. This proved crucial for the extended work needed on vehicle curves. -->

### Mental Preparation

This commission represented several firsts:
- Working to someone else's specifications
- Fixed deadline (general expectation, not hard date)
- Subjects that needed to be recognizable (their actual caravan and car)
- Space constraints not of my choosing
- Potential for client disappointment

**Mindset Adjustments Needed:**
- "Good enough" wouldn't be good enough
- Multiple rework cycles must be accepted
- Research before action (less trial-and-error)
- Document process for problem-solving
- Manage expectations (figures might not be portrait-quality)

I discussed with my son that the figures would be stylized rather than exact portraits - managing this expectation early was important.

---

### Timeline Estimate

**Initial Planning:** 7 months seemed reasonable

**Breakdown:**
- Caravan: 2-3 weeks
- Car: 2-3 weeks  
- Figures: 1 week
- Scenery: 2 weeks
- Final assembly: 1 week
- Buffer for rework: 3-4 weeks

*Reality: This was reasonably accurate - completed July 2025 (7 months)*

---

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Scale:** 1:42 (driven by caravan dimensions and base constraint)
2. **Build Order:** Caravan first (make-or-break component)
3. **Materials:** Willing to try new materials (air-dry clay, static grass, resin)
4. **Simplifications:** No awning, no extensive campsite, focus on core elements
5. **Quality Bar:** Multiple rework cycles acceptable to achieve client satisfaction

---

### Next Steps

With planning complete, the next phase: attempting the Eriba Triton caravan.

This was the moment of truth - could I actually build a recognizable miniature vehicle from scratch?

**Coming in Build Log 002:** *Caravan Construction - Three layers of balsa, countless hours with epoxy putty, and the challenge of those curved Eriba windows.*

---

### Reflection

Planning a commissioned piece feels different from planning personal projects. There's a weight of responsibility - capturing someone else's memories, meeting their expectations, working within their constraints.

But there's also motivation: the desire to deliver something that brings joy, captures a moment in time, preserves a memory.

The research phase revealed both challenges and possibilities. Every "this seems impossible" moment was balanced by "but someone else did it, so I can too."

Time to stop planning and start building.
