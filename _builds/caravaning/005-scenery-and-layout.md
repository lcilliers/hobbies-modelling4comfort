With all the main components complete (caravan, car, figures, and Tilly), I faced the challenge of creating a convincing Welsh riverside setting within tight space constraints.

**The Brief:**
- Riverside setting in Wales
- Native Welsh plants and trees
- Natural, not manicured
- Rocky riverbank
- Sense of depth despite small footprint
- Maximum display size: ~350mm x 250mm

**The Problem:** How do you suggest "Welsh countryside" without building an entire landscape? The scene needed to feel expansive while fitting on a small base.

### Space Management and Layout Strategy

  <figcaption>Working out the base layout - every millimeter counts</figcaption>
</figure>

**Constraints:**
- Base size: ~350mm x 250mm maximum
- Must accommodate caravan (70mm long)
- Must accommodate car (90mm long)
- Need space for figures
- Need to suggest river
- Need trees without crowding
- Must remain stable and transportable

**Layout Strategy:**

1. **Caravan Positioning:**
   - Slightly off-center (more natural)
   - Angled (not parallel to base edge)
   - Door facing toward viewer (showing detail)
   - Creates compositional interest

2. **Car Placement:**
   - Towing position behind caravan
   - Suggests "just arrived" or "about to depart"
   - Hitch connection visible

3. **River Location:**
   - Along one edge (allows suggestion without building entire river)
   - Diagonal flow (more interesting than straight)
   - Banks at different levels (topographic interest)

4. **Tree Placement:**
   - Background and sides (creates depth)
   - Varying heights (perspective)
   - Not blocking main subjects
   - Suggests continuation beyond base edges

5. **Figure Positioning:**
   - Near vehicles (logical placement)
   - Interacting with space
   - Tilly exploring (dog behavior)
   - Creating story moment

**Key Principle:** The base shows a "moment in time" within a larger landscape. Viewers' imagination fills in what continues beyond the edges.

  </figure>
</div>

To make the scene authentically Welsh, I researched typical riverside vegetation in Wales:

**Trees Common to Welsh Riversides:**
- **Oak** (Quercus robur) - iconic British tree
- **Willow** (Salix) - characteristic riverside trees
- **Alder** (Alnus glutinosa) - water-loving, common near streams
- **Ash** (Fraxinus excelsior) - common in Welsh valleys
- **Birch** (Betula) - lighter foliage, adds variety

**Understory Plants:**
- **Ferns** - abundant in damp Welsh climate
- **Nettles and dock** - realistic for riversides (though not pretty)
- **Wild grasses** - mixed heights and textures
- **Moss** - rocks and tree bases
- **Wild flowers** - foxglove, meadowsweet, primrose

**What to Avoid:**
- Palm trees (obviously not Welsh)
- Tropical plants
- Overly manicured appearance
- Mediterranean vegetation
- Desert plants

The key was creating the "feel" of Wales: lush, green, slightly wild, varied textures.

### Base Construction

**Base Structure:**

1. **Foundation:**
   - MDF board (~350mm x 250mm x 9mm)
   - Sealed with PVA (prevents warping)
   - Strong enough to handle weight
   - Transportable size

2. **Topography:**
   - Built up with foam board layers
   - Created gentle slopes
   - Carved river valley
   - Added rocky outcrops
   - Textured with filler/plaster mix

3. **Riverbank:**
   - Two levels (high bank, water level)
   - Rocky edge (small stones embedded)
   - Natural irregularity
   - Water area carved lower than surroundings

4. **Texture Layer:**
   - PVA and sand mix for general ground
   - Rougher texture near river (rocky)
   - Smoother areas for grass (campsite area)
   - Varied finish suggests different terrain types

    <figcaption>Completed tree with multiple foliage layers</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Tree Construction Process:**

1. **Wire Armature:**
   - Twisted wire for trunk and main branches
   - Multiple strands twisted (creates realistic bark texture)
   - Branches divide naturally (Y-junctions, not T-junctions)
   - Taper as branches get smaller
   - Overall tree shape before adding foliage

2. **Trunk Texture:**
   - Painted with dark brown/black
   - Dry brushed with lighter browns
   - Highlighted bark texture created by twisted wire
   - Different colors for different tree species
   - Some green tint on north side (moss effect)

3. **Foliage Material Testing:**

   **Attempt 1: Commercial foliage (foam clusters)**
   - ✅ Looked okay
   - ❌ Too uniform in texture
   - ❌ Limited color variety
   - ❌ Expensive

   **Attempt 2: Natural materials (dried herbs/moss)**
   - ✅ Interesting texture
   - ❌ Deteriorated over time
   - ❌ Color faded
   - ❌ Too fragile

   **Attempt 3: DIY foliage (stretched fiber + flock)**
   - ✅ Controllable texture
   - ✅ Can create varied densities
   - ✅ Mix multiple colors
   - ✅ Cost effective
   - ✅ **This was the winner**

4. **Foliage Application:**
   - Pull apart polyester fiber fill (creates web-like structure)
   - Stretch over wire branches
   - Spray with diluted PVA (holds shape)
   - Apply different colored ground foam/flock
   - Multiple colors (dark green, light green, yellow-green, brown)
   - Layer different textures (depth)
   - Less dense at edges (natural, not solid blobs)

**Tree Types Created:**
- 3 background trees (taller, establishing scale and depth)
- 2 mid-ground trees (frame composition)
- 1 foreground tree (detail, shows off technique)

Total trees: 6 (enough to suggest woodland without crowding)

### Custom Tool Development

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/caravaning/scenary/caravaning-scenary-018.jpg" alt="Custom tools">
  <figcaption>Custom tools developed for specific tasks</figcaption>
</figure>

During scenery construction, I made several custom tools:

**Static Grass Applicator:**
- Purpose: Stand grass fibers upright (realistic grass effect)
- Construction: Modified tea strainer + 9V battery + wire
- Theory: Static charge makes fibers stand up
- Reality: It worked! (somewhat unpredictably)
- Cost: ~£2 vs. £40+ for commercial version

**Foliage Applicator (Tweezer-Sifter Hybrid):**
- Purpose: Apply fine flock precisely
- Construction: Fine mesh + tweezers + small reservoir
- Allows controlled sprinkle of flock onto glue
- Better control than fingers or shakers

**Tree Bark Texture Tool:**
- Purpose: Create bark patterns in putty trunks
- Construction: Wire brush head wrapped with coarse thread
- Roll along wet putty = bark texture
- (Mostly used twisted wire trunks, but tool available)

**Lesson:** Sometimes making a simple tool takes 20 minutes and saves hours of frustration. Don't be afraid to make custom solutions.

    <figcaption>Painting rocks with varied colors - Welsh stone tones</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Rock Materials:**
- Real small stones (appropriate scale)
- Broken cork bark (looks like larger boulders)
- Carved foam (lightweight, large rocks)
- Plaster/filler (embedding and texture)

**Rock Placement Strategy:**
- Larger rocks near water (realistic erosion pattern)
- Smaller stones higher up bank
- Random placement (nature isn't regular)
- Some partially buried (realistic, not just sitting on surface)
- Varied colors (not all same stone type)

**Rock Painting:**
- Base coat: grey/brown mix
- Wash: diluted black (settles in cracks)
- Dry brush: light grey (highlights)
- Dry brush: green/brown (moss/lichen on some)
- Some orange/rust (iron in Welsh stone)
- Variation: Not all rocks same color

**Result:** Rocks read as Welsh stone - grey, weathered, varied, some with moss. Not pretty decorative stones, but realistic riverside rocks.

### Vegetation: Layers of Texture

  <figcaption>Building up vegetation in layers - creating depth and variety</figcaption>
</figure>

**Vegetation Application Strategy:**

**Layer 1 - Base Texture:**
- Fine sand/ballast
- Earth colors (brown, dark green)
- PVA adhesive
- Covers exposed base

**Layer 2 - Coarse Ground Cover:**
- Scatter materials (multiple colors)
- Varied shades of green
- Some brown (dead vegetation, dirt patches)
- Creates base for grass

**Layer 3 - Static Grass:**
- Multiple grass colors and lengths
- Applied in patches (not uniform lawn)
- Denser in some areas (campsite clearing)
- Sparser in others (rocky areas, under trees)
- Varied heights (2mm, 4mm, 6mm)

**Layer 4 - Accent Plants:**
- Fern fronds (made from painted fabric leaves)
- Taller grass tufts
- Wild flower clusters (small dried flowers painted)
- Patches of color (not just green)

**Layer 5 - Final Details:**
- Individual grass blades (tall, at edges)
- Fallen leaves (punched paper, painted)
- Small debris (tiny twigs, bark bits)
- Final flock and texture

**Key Principle:** Nature has layers of texture at different scales. Replicating this in miniature creates convincing landscape depth.

### The Composition Coming Together

    <figcaption>Adjusting positions for best visual flow</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Compositional Considerations:**

**Visual Flow:**
- Viewer's eye enters scene through foreground
- Travels to main subjects (car, caravan, figures)
- Explores details (Tilly, trees, river)
- Suggests continuation beyond edges

**Depth Cues:**
- Objects overlap (foreground over background)
- Size variation (larger near, smaller far)
- Detail gradation (more detail near, less detail far)
- Color shift (slightly hazier in background)

**Balance:**
- Not centered (more interesting)
- Weight distributed (not all on one side)
- Vertical elements (trees) balance horizontal elements (car/caravan)
- Negative space (allows breathing room)

**Story Elements:**
- Caravan and car suggest travel/arrival
- Figures near vehicles (setup/pack-up moment)
- Tilly exploring (dog behavior, adds life)
- Riverside setting (peaceful, vacation feel)

**What Makes it Work:**
- Clear focal point (vehicles and figures)
- Supporting elements don't distract
- Sense of place (Welsh riverside)
- Tells a story (family trip moment)

### Problem Solving: Limited Space

**Challenges Encountered:**

1. **Trees Too Tall:**
   - First trees overwhelmed scene
   - **Solution:** Made shorter trees, saved tall ones for background
   - Varied heights create depth without dominating

2. **River Too Wide:**
   - Initial river took too much space
   - **Solution:** Narrowed river, made it diagonal (suggests flow continues)
   - Implied water more effective than showing entire river

3. **Too Much Vegetation:**
   - First attempt looked cluttered
   - **Solution:** Removed some vegetation, left space for eye to rest
   - Less is more - strategic placement beats blanket coverage

4. **Figures Got Lost:**
   - Figures disappeared among scenery
   - **Solution:** Cleared immediate area around figures, created "campsite clearing"
   - Natural but provides focus area

5. **Base Edge Treatment:**
   - Hard edges looked artificial
   - **Solution:** Brought vegetation and texture to edges, broke up hard line
   - Scene feels continuous beyond base

### Skills Developed

**New Skills:**
- Miniature tree construction from wire
- DIY foliage creation (fiber + flock)
- Static grass application
- Multi-layer vegetation techniques
- Composition planning with fixed elements
- Working within strict space constraints
- Custom tool making for specific tasks

**Improved Skills:**
- Color variation in natural elements
- Texture layering for depth
- Creating impression of larger space in limited area
- Strategic detail placement

**Research Skills:**
- Plant identification and regional flora
- Reference gathering for natural landscapes
- Understanding landscape composition

**Important Lesson:** Scenery is about suggestion and layers. You're creating the *impression* of a landscape, not recreating every blade of grass. Strategic detail work beats trying to cover everything.

### The Scene Taking Shape

  <figcaption>The Welsh riverside taking shape - trees, rocks, vegetation creating the setting</figcaption>
</figure>

With the scenery largely complete, the diorama transformed from "components on a base" to "a place." The caravan and car now sit in a Welsh riverside setting that feels authentic and lived-in.

**What's Working:**
- Trees create depth and frame the scene
- Rocky riverbank suggests flowing water nearby
- Layered vegetation provides texture and realism
- Composition draws eye to main subjects
- Space feels larger than actual base size
- Authentically Welsh feel (green, lush, slightly wild)

**What Remains:**
- Ground cover completion (static grass areas)
- River water effects (resin water)
- Final integration of all elements
- Last details and weathering

Two major elements remained: completing the grass work to create the campsite feel, and adding the river water to bring the scene to life.

---

### Reflections

**What Worked:**
- DIY foliage technique (cost-effective, controllable)
- Layered vegetation approach (creates depth)
- Research into Welsh flora (authentic feel)
- Custom tools (solved specific problems)
- Strategic space management (fits despite constraints)

**What Was Challenging:**
- Working within tight space constraints
- Balancing detail with viewing distance
- Preventing scene from looking cluttered
- Creating depth in limited area
- Time management (20 hours flew by)

**What I'd Do Differently:**
- Make test trees before final trees (learned as I went)
- Plan vegetation placement more carefully (removed some initially placed)
- Take more in-process photos (focused on building, forgot to document)

**Key Insight:** Scenery is as much about what you leave out as what you include. The space between elements matters as much as the elements themselves.

---

### Next Steps

With the landscape and vegetation largely complete, two major tasks remained:

1. **Ground cover completion** - finishing the static grass application, creating the campsite clearing, final vegetation details
2. **River effects** - creating flowing water with resin, painting the river bed, achieving realistic water appearance

These final elements would transform the setting from "background" to "environment."

**Coming in Build Log 006:** *Static Grass and River Effects - Creating realistic grass coverage and water using resin techniques.*

**Time Spent:** 20 hours  
**Trees Built:** 6  
**Custom Tools Made:** 3  
**Research Hours:** ~4 hours (Welsh flora and riverside landscapes)
