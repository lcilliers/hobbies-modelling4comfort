## Current Build Stage

**Phase:** Vessel Construction - Fishing Trawler  
**Focus:** Building the small coastal fishing boat in distress that will be the subject of the rescue operation

## Build Approach

Following the planning phase decisions, I'm constructing a small coastal fishing trawler approximately 9-10cm in length at 1:72 scale (representing a 7m vessel). This boat will appear weathered and in distress, listing slightly to add drama to the rescue scene.

The main construction will be balsawood.

There are several options to get started, taking into account that one of my main deficiencies to overcome is the ability to make engineering drawings:

- buy and build a kit, then use this build to scale down the trawler to the diorama scale and rebuild it from scratch
- get balsawood building plans for a trawler, scale the drawings and build from the plan
- design and build the trawler using images and youtube videos, prototyping as I go.

The deciding factor would be the availability of suitable plans or the cost of a suitable kit against this weird inner voice calling for constructing from pictures.

## Work Completed

### Hull Construction

The hull forms the foundation of the trawler and needs to convey both the working nature of the vessel and its current distress:

- **Hull Shape:** Carved from basswood using the traditional boat-building approach
- **Method:** Roughed out overall shape with craft knife, refined with sanding blocks
- **Design:** Characteristic fishing boat lines - wider beam for stability, modest freeboard
- **Distress Position:** Built with slight list angle to suggest trouble

### Superstructure & Wheelhouse

Small fishing trawlers have a distinctive wheelhouse forward of the working deck:

- **Wheelhouse Construction:** Built from styrene sheet (0.5mm and 1mm)
- **Windows:** Cut openings for wheelhouse windows, will add clear plastic later
- **Roof:** Slightly angled roof typical of working vessels
- **Details:** Door opening on port side

### Deck Features

The working deck needs to convey the vessel's fishing purpose:

- **Main Deck:** Balsa sheet planking with scribed plank lines
- **Gunwales:** Strip wood reinforcement along deck edges
- **Hatches:** Small hatch covers scratch-built from card and strip wood
- **Bulwarks:** Low side walls built up from basswood strips

### Equipment & Details

Working vessels accumulate equipment and gear:

- **Mast:** Brass rod for a simple mast with derrick/boom arrangement
- **Winch:** Scratch-built winch housing from styrene scraps
- **Cleats & Fittings:** Small cleats formed from brass wire
- **Rail Details:** Safety rails from fine brass wire

## Techniques Used

### Carved Basswood Hull

Working with basswood for hull construction:

- Draw waterline and profile views on block
- Rough cut with craft knife, working from centerline outward
- Sand to smooth curves using progressively finer grades
- Seal with diluted PVA before painting

### Scribed Plank Lines

Creating realistic deck planking:

- Rule pencil lines for plank positions
- Score along ruler with blunt needle or scribing tool
- Don't press too deep - subtle is realistic
- Slight irregularities add character

### Scratch-Built Wheelhouse

Building small structures from styrene:

- Cut pieces slightly oversize
- Test fit before gluing
- Use liquid poly cement for strong bonds
- Square up with set square during assembly

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Scale Accuracy at 1:72

**The Problem:**  
At 1:72 scale, the trawler is only 9-10cm long. Details must be simplified while remaining recognizable. Too much detail looks busy; too little looks toy-like.

**The Solution:**  
Focus on key characteristic features - wheelhouse shape, deck layout, mast position. Suggest detail rather than attempting every fitting. Paint and weathering will add visual complexity.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Working at this scale requires restraint. "Suggestion" is more effective than precise reproduction.

### Challenge 2: Hull Shaping Symmetry

**The Problem:**  
Carving a symmetrical hull freehand is challenging. One side becoming heavier than the other throws off the look.

**The Solution:**  
Frequent measuring with calipers. Mark centerline clearly. Sand both sides equally, checking frequently. Hold hull up to light to spot asymmetries.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Patience with hull shaping pays off. Rush the sanding and you end up with problems that show even after painting.

### Challenge 3: Tiny Wheelhouse Windows

**The Problem:**  
Cutting clean window openings in 0.5mm styrene at this scale without cracking or warping the material.

**The Solution:**  
Score outline heavily with new blade. Make multiple passes rather than trying to cut through in one go. Support material from behind. Use sharp punch for corners if available.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Sharp blades are essential for small-scale work. Dull blades tear rather than cut.

## Materials & Tools Used

### Materials
- Basswood block (2cm x 3cm x 10cm for hull carving)
- Styrene sheet (0.5mm and 1mm for superstructure)
- Balsa sheet (1mm for decking)
- Basswood strip (various sizes for details)
- Brass rod (1mm for mast)
- Brass wire (0.3mm for rails and rigging)
- Liquid poly cement for styrene
- PVA glue for wood
- CA glue for brass fittings

### Tools
- Craft knife with #11 blades (fresh blades essential)
- Sanding blocks (coarse, medium, fine)
- Metal ruler and set square
- Small files for detail work
- Pin vise and drill bits for rigging points
- Calipers for symmetry checks
- Scribing tool for plank lines

## Next Steps

The fishing trawler hull and superstructure are now complete. Next stages:

1. **Painting:** Base coat and color scheme appropriate to working fishing vessel
2. **Weathering:** Heavy weathering to show hard-worked vessel - rust, salt spray, worn paint
3. **Rigging:** Add fishing gear, ropes, nets (suggested rather than detailed)
4. **Final Details:** Navigation lights, name board, registration numbers
5. **Crew Figures:** Small figures to show scale and add life
6. **Distress Elements:** Visual indicators of the vessel's trouble (listing, damage suggestions)

Once the trawler is complete, it will be positioned on the diorama base to establish the rescue scene composition before constructing the RNLI rescue boat.

## Time Investment

**This Session:** Approximately 8-10 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Hull carving and shaping: 4 hours
- Wheelhouse construction: 2 hours
- Deck and details: 2 hours
- Equipment and fittings: 2 hours

**Total Project Time So Far:** 12-15 hours (including planning phase)

**Status:** Fishing trawler hull and basic structure complete, ready for painting and weathering  
**Next Log:** Construction of the RNLI B-class Atlantic 85 rescue boat  
**Estimated Next Update:** Early January 2026
