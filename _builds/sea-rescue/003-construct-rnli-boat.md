## Current Build Stage

**Phase:** Vessel Construction - RNLI Rescue Boat  
**Focus:** Building the RNLI B-class Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboat, the hero vessel responding to the fishing trawler in distress

## Build Approach

Following the planning phase specifications, I'm constructing a B-class Atlantic 85 rescue boat approximately 11.8cm in length at 1:72 scale (representing the real 8.5m vessel). This rigid inflatable boat (RIB) has distinctive features that make it instantly recognizable as an RNLI rescue craft.

## Work Completed

### Hull & Rigid Base Construction

The Atlantic 85 has a unique rigid hull beneath inflatable tubes:

- **Rigid Hull Base:** Built from balsa sheet laminated to create hull depth
- **Hull Shape:** Characteristic deep-V hull for rough water capability
- **Carving:** Shaped to represent the rigid fiberglass center section
- **Console Position:** Marked location for helm console and crew positions
- **Transom:** Squared-off stern typical of RIB design

### Inflatable Tube Structure

The distinctive orange inflatable tubes that give RIBs their character:

- **Tube Framework:** Balsa strips bent and shaped to follow hull outline
- **Tube Sections:** Built up from multiple layers to create rounded profile
- **Port & Starboard:** Symmetrical construction, frequent checking
- **Bow Section:** Careful shaping of the rounded bow tube junction
- **Method:** Layered balsa strips with sanding to achieve rounded cross-section

### Console & Steering Position

The helm console is a key feature of the Atlantic 85:

- **Console Base:** Scratch-built from styrene sheet
- **Windscreen:** Clear styrene for the wraparound windscreen
- **Control Station:** Suggested steering wheel and controls
- **Crew Positions:** Space for three crew figures (helmsman and two crew)
- **Radar Arch:** Brass rod framework for equipment mounting

### RNLI Equipment & Details

Authentic rescue boat equipment:

- **Navigation Lights:** Small beads for port, starboard, and masthead lights
- **VHF Aerials:** Fine brass wire aerials on radar arch
- **Boarding Ladder:** Scratch-built ladder sections for boat sides
- **Rope Cleats:** Tiny cleats formed from brass wire
- **Rescue Equipment:** Suggested life rings and throw bags
- **Kill Cord:** Thin wire representing engine safety cut-off

### Outboard Motors

The Atlantic 85 is powered by twin outboard engines:

- **Motor Casings:** Carved from balsa to represent engine cowlings
- **Mounting Brackets:** Styrene strips for motor brackets
- **Propellers:** Brass wire bent and shaped for prop suggestion
- **Twin Configuration:** Both motors mounted on transom

## Techniques Used

### RIB Tube Construction

Creating the characteristic inflatable tubes:

- Start with straight balsa strip along hull line
- Build up thickness with additional layers
- Sand to rounded profile using half-round file
- Work slowly - tubes must be symmetrical
- Frequent reference to photos for profile shape

### Clear Styrene Windscreen

Working with clear plastic:

- Cut carefully with fresh blade to avoid scratching
- Polish edges with fine sandpaper then buffing compound
- Form gentle curves by warming slightly (carefully!)
- Test fit before final gluing - mistakes show on clear parts

### Scale Equipment Details

Creating tiny fittings and equipment:

- Use photo references at high magnification
- Suggest rather than precisely replicate
- Consider what's visible and what adds to recognition
- Paint and decals will add detail that's hard to build

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Inflatable Tube Symmetry

**The Problem:**  
The inflatable tubes must be identical on port and starboard sides, but building curved, rounded structures symmetrically is difficult. Slight variations show clearly and spoil the look.

**The Solution:**  
Created a simple jig from scrap wood to hold hull while working. Built both sides simultaneously - one strip of balsa, measure, cut two identical pieces, glue both before moving to next layer. Constant measuring with calipers. Frequent visual checks from dead ahead and astern.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Symmetry is critical on a rescue boat. The eye picks up asymmetry immediately. Time spent on accuracy during construction saves frustration later.

### Challenge 2: Orange Color Match

**The Problem:**  
RNLI orange is a specific, recognizable color. Too red looks wrong, too yellow looks wrong. The color is part of the vessel's identity.

**The Solution:**  
Research showed RNLI uses "International Orange" (close to Pantone 165). Mixed custom orange from red, yellow, and white acrylics, testing on scrap until match was close to reference photos. Made enough mixed paint for entire boat to ensure consistency.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Iconic color schemes need accuracy. When something is instantly recognizable by color, getting it right matters. Test on scrap first.

### Challenge 3: Scale vs. Recognition

**The Problem:**  
At 1:72 scale, some equipment and details become so small they're nearly impossible to build accurately. But an RNLI boat needs to be recognizable.

**The Solution:**  
Focused on silhouette and key recognition features: tube shape, console windscreen, twin engines, radar arch, orange color, blue and white markings. Let paint and weathering suggest smaller details. Viewers recognize the boat from these key elements.

**Lessons Learned:**  
At small scales, silhouette and color scheme carry more recognition value than tiny details. Focus on what makes the vessel immediately identifiable.

## Materials & Tools Used

### Materials
- Balsa sheet (2mm and 3mm for hull and tubes)
- Balsa strips (various sizes for tube building)
- Styrene sheet (0.5mm for console, brackets)
- Clear styrene (for windscreen)
- Brass rod (1mm for radar arch)
- Brass wire (0.3mm for aerials, rails, details)
- Balsa for engine casings
- PVA glue for balsa work
- CA glue for brass and final assembly
- Acrylic paints (custom-mixed RNLI orange)

### Tools
- Craft knife with fresh #11 blades
- Sanding blocks and files (including half-round)
- Pin vise and small drill bits
- Calipers for symmetry checks
- Small clamps and clips for gluing
- Fine brushes for detail painting
- Buffing cloth for clear styrene

## Next Steps

The RNLI rescue boat structure is complete. Remaining work:

1. **Base Painting:** RNLI orange for tubes, blue for console area
2. **RNLI Markings:** White hull numbers, RNLI lettering, blue flashes
3. **Equipment Painting:** Navigation lights, engine details, hardware
4. **Weathering:** Moderate weathering - rescue boats are well-maintained but show use
5. **Crew Figures:** Three crew members - helmsman and two crew in positions
6. **Final Details:** Life rings, ropes, radio aerials

Once both vessels are complete, focus moves to the seascape base construction and positioning the vessels in their rescue scene composition.

## Time Investment

**This Session:** Approximately 10-12 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Hull and rigid base: 3 hours
- Inflatable tube construction: 5 hours (most time-consuming part)
- Console and steering: 2 hours
- Equipment and engines: 2 hours

**Total Project Time So Far:** 22-27 hours (including planning and fishing trawler)

**Status:** RNLI rescue boat structure complete, ready for painting and markings  
**Next Log:** Will cover seascape base construction, water effects, and final positioning  
**Estimated Next Update:** Mid-January 2026
