## Project Inception

The Sea Rescue project represents an exciting new direction - combining maritime modeling skills with the challenge of creating a dynamic action scene. This build will explore vessel construction, realistic water effects, and the drama of rescue operations at sea.

This is also the first model I am actively using GoPilot to give input in the design and build.

## Initial Concept

The vision is to create a compelling maritime rescue scene that captures:
- **Action and Movement:** A vessel in operation, not static at dock
- **Realistic Environment:** Dynamic seascape with waves and spray
- **Authentic Details:** Proper scale rescue equipment and features
- **Story and Drama:** A moment frozen in time that tells a story

Following a request to Gopilot, can you prepare an example of a UK nation sea rescue diorama scene that can be built from scratch - it came back with :  plans to scratch-build a complete 1:72 RNLI sea rescue diorama, featuring:

A B-class RNLI Atlantic 85 open sea rescue boat
A small coastal fishing boat in distress
A cliff edge with rocks backdrop
All figures (RNLI crew + fishing crew)
A compact base ideal for 25 × 25 cm

## Research Phase

### RNLI History

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has saved over 146,000 lives at sea since its founding in 1824, celebrating its 200th anniversary in 2024. This volunteer-run charity operates across the UK and Ireland with a fleet of lifeboats ranging from small inshore craft to large all-weather vessels. The unique designs of RNLI rescue boats have evolved through multiple iterations, with each generation incorporating lessons learned from countless rescues. The Shannon class represents the latest advancement in lifeboat design, featuring self-righting capabilities, advanced navigation systems, and exceptional sea-keeping abilities.

### Vessel Type Options

Deciding on the type of rescue vessel to model:

**Historic Options:**
- Traditional lifeboat (RNLI heritage vessels)
- Early motor lifeboats (1920s-1950s)
- Sailing rescue boats

**Modern Options:**
- Current RNLI lifeboats (Severn, Tamar, Shannon class)
- Rigid inflatable boats (RIB)
- Search and Rescue vessels

**Considerations:**
- Available reference materials
- Build complexity vs. skill level
- Visual interest and character
- Scale feasibility at 1:50

### Reference Materials Needed

Planning to gather:
- Technical drawings and plans (if available)
- Photographs from multiple angles
- Construction details and specifications
- Equipment and rigging details
- Color schemes and livery
- Operational context images

### Scale Calculations

Working at 1:72 scale (1m real life = 1.39cm at scale):

**RNLI Vessel Options:**
- **B-class Atlantic 85 (8.5m real):** 11.8cm model length
- **D-class IB1 (7.3m real):** 10.1cm model length
- **Tamar class all-weather (16m real):** 22.2cm model length
- **Shannon class all-weather (13m real):** 18.1cm model length

**Fishing Boat Options:**
- **Small coastal fishing boat (7m real):** 9.7cm model length
- **Medium fishing vessel (10m real):** 13.9cm model length
- **Larger trawler (15m real):** 20.8cm model length

**Diorama Base:**
- **Planned base size:** 25cm × 25cm
- **Represents real area (at 1:72):** 18m × 18m

Considering both build size and display practicality, the B-class Atlantic 85 at 11.8cm and a small fishing boat at 9-10cm will fit comfortably on a 25cm × 25cm base with room for waves, cliff backdrop, and composition.

## Build Methodology Questions

### Hull Construction Approach

Exploring options:
1. **Planked hull:** Traditional boat-building in miniature
2. **Carved foam:** Shaped and sealed, then detailed
3. **Styrene construction:** Engineered approach with sheet plastic
4. **Hybrid:** Combining methods for best results

### Water Effects Technique

Researching methods:
- Clear resin pours with painted base
- Acrylic gel medium sculpted into waves
- Layered effects for depth and foam
- Wave crests and spray techniques

### Base and Presentation

Planning considerations:
- Base size to complement vessel scale
- Frame or natural edge presentation
- Integration of sea and vessel
- Mounting and stability

## Technical Challenges to Solve

1. **Realistic water movement:** Capturing wave dynamics at small scale
2. **Weathering effects:** Salt spray, rust, worn paint authentically
3. **Fine details:** Railings, equipment, rigging at 1:50
4. **Action pose:** Vessel attitude in rough sea - angle and position
5. **Structural integrity:** Ensuring durability despite dynamic pose

## Material Requirements - Preliminary List

### Vessel Construction
- Basswood or balsa sheet (various thicknesses)
- Styrene sheet and rod
- Brass rod and wire (railings, equipment)
- Dowel for masts/supports

### Seascape
- Clear casting resin or acrylic gel medium
- Foam board or MDF base
- Acrylic paints (blues, greens, whites)
- Modeling paste for texture

### Details & Finishing
- Miniature figures (crew, 1:50 scale)
- Thread or fine wire (rigging)
- Weathering pigments
- Clear gloss and matte varnish

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize vessel choice** - Research and decide on specific rescue vessel type
2. **Gather references** - Collect photos, plans, specifications
3. **Create detailed plan** - Scale drawings and construction sequence
4. **Source materials** - Acquire specific materials based on chosen approach
5. **Test techniques** - Small-scale tests of water effects and weathering
6. **Begin construction** - Start with hull and base structure

## Timeline Considerations

This project runs alongside completing documentation for finished projects on the site. Build progress will be steady but measured, allowing time for:
- Thorough research and planning
- Technique experimentation and testing
- Quality construction without rushing
- Comprehensive photography and documentation

## Inspiration & Goals

The goal is to create a piece that:
- Honors the bravery of rescue service personnel
- Demonstrates maritime modeling skills
- Explores new techniques in water and weathering effects
- Tells a compelling visual story
- Provides satisfaction in the building process

## Research Resources to Explore

- RNLI website and historical archive
- Maritime museum collections online
- Model boat building forums and communities
- YouTube channels on maritime modeling
- Books on rescue vessel history and operation

**Current Status:** Planning and research phase  
**Next Build Log:** Will document vessel selection and initial construction approach

*This project is at the beginning of its journey. Follow along as planning develops into construction and the rescue scene comes to life.*
