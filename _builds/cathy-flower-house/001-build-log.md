## Project Start

Started this delightful Rolife miniature kit on December 26, 2023. Cathy's Flower House is a charming flower shop scene that combines architectural elements with beautiful botanical details.

## Kit Contents

The Rolife kit arrived well-packaged with:
- Pre-cut wooden structural pieces
- Detailed paper flower elements
- LED lighting components
- Miniature furniture and accessories
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- All necessary assembly materials

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Structure Assembly

The build began with assembling the main wooden structure. The pre-cut pieces fit together well, creating the shop's framework. The quality of the laser-cut components made alignment straightforward.
