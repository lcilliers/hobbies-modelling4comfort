## Today's Work Session

Started the base construction for the winter diorama. The goal today was to create the basic terrain shape and texture before moving on to painting and snow effects.

## Building the Base

### Step 1: Planning the Layout

Before cutting any foam, I sketched out the composition on paper. The scene will feature:
- A slight hill on the left side
- A flat area in the center for the vehicle
- Some texture variations to add visual interest

### Step 2: Cutting the Foam

Using a hot wire foam cutter, I shaped the XPS foam to create the basic terrain contours. Key points:

- Started with 2" thick foam for good depth
- Cut gradual slopes rather than sharp angles
- Left the center relatively flat for stability
- Added some subtle undulations for natural look

**Tip**: Work slowly with the hot wire cutter to get smooth, clean cuts. Fast movements create rough, uneven surfaces that require more cleanup.

### Step 3: Texturing

After the basic shape was complete, I added surface texture:

1. **Rough Texturing**: Used a wire brush to create irregular patterns
2. **Fine Detail**: Carved small ruts and tracks with sculpting tools
3. **Surface Variation**: Applied diluted PVA glue mixed with sand

The texture paste will go on later, after I'm happy with the basic groundwork.

## Challenges Faced

The main challenge today was getting the slope angles right. My first attempt was too steep, making it look unnatural. I had to trim it back and smooth it out several times before I was satisfied.

## What Worked Well

The wire brush texture technique worked perfectly. It creates a nice, natural-looking ground surface that isn't too uniform or artificial.

## Time Spent

Approximately 3 hours for this session:
- Planning and sketching: 30 minutes
- Foam cutting and shaping: 1.5 hours
- Texturing: 1 hour

## Next Session Plans

1. Seal the foam with diluted PVA glue
2. Apply texture paste to selected areas
3. Prime the entire base
4. Start with base color painting

## Materials Notes

**XPS Foam**: Bought from local hardware store - much cheaper than hobby foam and works just as well for bases.

**Wire Brush**: Using an old metal wire brush - perfect for creating ground texture without spending on specialized tools.

## Tips for Others

If you're building your first diorama base:

- Don't rush the planning phase - spend time on your composition
- Build up texture gradually - it's easier to add more than to remove excess
- Test your techniques on scrap foam first
- Keep your vehicle/figures nearby to check scale and fit regularly
