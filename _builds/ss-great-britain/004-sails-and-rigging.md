With the masts up, and the and all the rope eyelits on the deck and the masts, the sails and rigging had to be figured out.  Without the example of the Gorch Fock around I would have not figured it out.  Sail cloth is sourced and the layout and measurements of all the sails cut out of paper, 15 in total. Without a sowing machine, the seams of the sails were all glued in with cloth material glue.

## Sails and rigging

The rope ladders were knotted individually. Research helped to uncover the design of a handy tool to keep the rope tight and allow for tying all the knots.

Installing the sails, rigging and tackle were a sigificant challenge. I bought and made several tools to help, including dressmaking scissors, crochet needles, sail cloth, green cotton string for the tackle and white cotton string for the ropes. The pullies was particularly difficult to manufacture due to its small size and drilling the 1 mm holes, get the rope trough it and tying to pullies to the masts presented much practice in miniature work under magnifiers.  Patience and endurance were discovered in places where I did not think it existed.

Finalinally the completed ship was ready for final decoration and completion.
