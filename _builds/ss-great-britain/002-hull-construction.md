Getting started with the actual build commenced with calculating the base measurements. I got most of the key measurements from the [Wikipedia article on SS Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Britain).  Most of the detail measurements were gathered from other pictures and calculated based on the length of the ship in the picture.  

## Dimensions and Scale

**Scale: 1:300** (calculated from actual model measurements)

| Measurement              | Real Ship (ft) | Model (cm) | Model (mm) |
|--------------------------|---------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| Length (w/o bowsprit)    | 322.00         | 33.00      | 330.00     |
| Beam (width)             | 50.50          | 5.50       | 55.00      |
| Chimney height           | 8.00           | 6.50       | 65.00      |
| Main sail height (deck)  | -              | 18.00      | 180.00     |
| Bulkhead to bulkhead     | 25.00          | 2.57       | 25.70      |
| Height (deck to keel)    | 32.50          | 3.34       | 33.40      |
| Propeller diameter       | 15.50          | 1.59       | 15.90      |

## The hull framework

With the length and the beam, I could proceed to draft the deck and the hull framework.  Personally, I have a big shortccoming, in that I never learnt to do proper drawings, and just had to resort to trial and error, pen and paper, and cutting the forms out of paper to visually confirm the layout.  Not ideal, but it served me well.

Using a paper model I attempted to visualise the taper of the hull, and proceded to use a mixture of pinewood and balsawood to form the deck and main ridge.  The ribs were added to prepare for forming the metal sheeting over the ribs. The ribs did not work well, and I replaced it by forming the hull in processive sheets of balsawood.

The core of the hull was filled with sawdust and glue, ready for the steel hull.  Beer cans turned out to have just the right thickness of steel to proceed with the forming of the outer skin. Strips of beer cans were then glued in place with superglue.

## Techniques Required

For this build, I'll need to develop or refine:

1. **Iron Hull Detailing**
   - Simulating riveted iron plates
   - Panel line enhancement
   - Weathering for oxidized metal

**Hull Construction:**
- Challenge: Achieving convincing iron plate appearance
- Approach: Research photo-etch options, scribing techniques, weathering methods

**Phase 1: Hull** (Weeks 1-6)
- Basic hull assembly
- Add iron plate detailing
- Paint base colors
- Initial weathering

### Hull & Structure
- Detailed iron plating with rivet work
- Authentic waterline and copper bottom
- Proper deck planking with caulking lines
- Accurate funnel and ventilation details

## Current Build Stage

**Phase:** Hull Construction  
**Focus:** Iron hull assembly and detailing

## Work Completed Since Last Update

- Hull assembly started
- Iron plating details being added
- Structural work in progress
- Testing techniques for realistic iron appearance
