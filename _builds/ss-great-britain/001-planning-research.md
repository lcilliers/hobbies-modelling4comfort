<div style="text-align: left; padding-top: 10px;">
This magnificent model of the SS Great Britain displayed in the entrance of the museum, reminded me of the the Gorch Foch I built 18 months earlier and sparked my interest to tackle another one. Back home I started the search for a kit or model building plans but had no luck.  At one time I ordered an advertised item, just to be told that it is no longer available and there are no indication when they will be able to source it again.  A number of other models could be traced online but unfortunely no kits or complete building plans.

## Research & Reference Materials

### Historical Background

The SS Great Britain was revolutionary for her time (1843):
- First ocean-going iron-hulled ship
- First to use screw propeller for Atlantic crossing
- Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel
- Now preserved as museum ship in Bristol

### Reference Sources Collected

**Visual References:** 87 photos including:
- Museum photos of the restored ship
- Historical drawings and paintings
- Technical plans and cross-sections
- Detail shots of hull plating, rigging, deck fittings
- Period photographs from archives

**Technical Documentation:**
- Original ship plans from Bristol archives
- Hull construction diagrams
- Rigging plans for both sail and steam configurations
- Deck layout drawings

### Kit Selection

**Chosen Kit:** Revell SS Great Britain 1:150 scale

**Reasons:**
- Good level of detail for this scale
- Reasonably accurate hull lines
- Includes basic rigging components
- Affordable and readily available
- Established modeling community with tips

**Known Issues to Address:**
- Hull plating detail needs enhancement
- Rigging supplied is simplified
- Deck fittings require additional detailing
- Paint scheme needs research for accuracy

## Techniques to Learn

For this build, I'll need to develop or refine:

1. **Iron Hull Detailing**
   - Simulating riveted iron plates
   - Panel line enhancement
   - Weathering for oxidized metal

2. **Complex Rigging**
   - Six-masted sailing configuration
   - Running vs standing rigging differentiation
   - Proper tension and scale appearance

3. **Steam Era Details**
   - Funnel weathering
   - Coal dust effects
   - Brass/copper fittings

4. **Mixed Construction**
   - Combining plastic kit with scratch-built details
   - Photo-etched brass enhancements
   - Wood deck overlays

## Challenges Anticipated

### Technical Challenges

**Hull Construction:**
- Challenge: Achieving convincing iron plate appearance
- Approach: Research photo-etch options, scribing techniques, weathering methods

**Scale Rigging:**
- Challenge: Managing complexity of six masts plus steam rigging
- Approach: Study period photos, create rigging diagram, work systematically

**Historical Accuracy:**
- Challenge: Ship had multiple configurations through her life
- Approach: Choose specific period (1845 maiden voyage configuration)

### Practical Challenges

**Time Investment:**
- This will be a long-term project (estimated 4-6 months)
- Need to maintain momentum through complex phases
- Document regularly even when progress seems slow

**Workspace:**
- Large model requires dedicated space
- Rigging phase needs room to work around entire model
- Photo setup for documentation

**Reference Management:**
- 87 reference photos need organization
- Cross-reference between plans and photos
- Track which references apply to which period

## Materials & Tools Preparation

### Ordered/Acquired:

- Revell SS Great Britain kit (1:150)
- Additional brass photo-etch detail set
- Scale rigging thread in various diameters
- Specialized ship model paints (iron oxide, coal black, etc.)
- Scribing tools for panel lines

### Still Needed:

- Brass rod for mast reinforcement
- Wood deck planking material
- Additional reference books
- Rigging blocks and deadeyes
- Display base materials

## Build Strategy

### Phased Approach:

**Phase 1: Hull** (Weeks 1-6)
- Basic hull assembly
- Add iron plate detailing
- Paint base colors
- Initial weathering

**Phase 2: Superstructure** (Weeks 7-10)
- Deck construction
- Funnel assembly and detailing
- Deckhouse construction
- Install major fittings

**Phase 3: Masts & Rigging** (Weeks 11-16)
- Mast construction and installation
- Standing rigging first
- Running rigging systematically
- Sail installation (if including)

**Phase 4: Finishing** (Weeks 17-18)
- Final weathering
- Detail painting
- Base construction
- Photography

## Next Steps

1. **Organize References**
   - Sort 87 photos by subject (hull, rigging, details, etc.)
   - Create reference binder for workbench
   - Print key plans for easy reference

2. **Kit Inventory**
   - Open kit and inventory all parts
   - Check for damage or missing pieces
   - Wash sprues to remove mold release

3. **Workspace Setup**
   - Clear dedicated build area
   - Set up good lighting
   - Organize tools and materials
   - Prepare photo documentation setup

4. **Begin Hull Work**
   - Study hull assembly instructions
   - Test fit major hull sections
   - Plan iron plate detail approach
   - Start Build Log #002 when hull work begins

## Time Investment

**This Planning Phase:** Approximately 8-10 hours
- Research: 4 hours
- Reference gathering: 3 hours  
- Kit selection and ordering: 1 hour
- Planning and documentation: 2 hours

## Lessons from Previous Projects

Building the Gorch Fock taught me:
- Importance of thorough planning before starting
- Document as you go - memory fades quickly
- Test techniques on scrap before applying to model
- Rigging requires patience - can't be rushed
- Good references are worth the time to gather

The SS Great Britain will be more ambitious in every way, but that experience provides a foundation to build on.
