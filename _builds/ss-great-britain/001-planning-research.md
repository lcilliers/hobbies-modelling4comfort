<div style="text-align: left; padding-top: 10px;">
This magnificent model of the SS Great Britain displayed in the entrance of the museum, reminded me of the the Gorch Foch I built 18 months earlier and sparked my interest to tackle another one. Back home I started the search for a kit or model building plans but had no luck.  At one time I ordered an advertised item, just to be told that it is no longer available and there are no indication when they will be able to source it again.  A number of other models could be traced online but unfortunely no kits or complete building plans where found. All these pictures contributed to this build in some or other way.

## Research and planning the build:

in this phase I focussed on sourcing a suitable kit, and after failed attempts started to collate reference materials about the ship and about building a model without detail cutting plans.  The reference materials included online resources such as historical drawings, photographs, museum documentation and general knowledge of ships in the era.  I also sources a book about the SS Great Britain, and on how to build model ships.  The book Model Ships from Scratch by Scott Robinson was very helpful.

Discovering the resources, materials, methods and how to go about it was an ongoing process throughout the build.  The following pictures celebarate those that had the biggest impact.

### Historical Background

The SS Great Britain was revolutionary for her time (1843):
- First ocean-going iron-hulled ship
- First to use screw propeller for Atlantic crossing
- Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel
- Now preserved as museum ship in Bristol

### drawings and plans

    <div class="caption">this diagram of the interiors did provide input on the proportial positioning of the items on the deck</div>
  </div>
  <div>

    <div class="caption">this diagram, nonwithstanding poor quality, provided good insight in the rigging</div>
  </div>
</div>

The diagrams and historical drawings was particularly handy to assess the layout of the deck and proportial measurements of the positioning of the chimney and masts, rigging and hull shape. The different diagrams emphasized the fact that the ship changed layout, number of masts, and usage over time.

### pictures of the ship itself

A few pictures could be traced of the ship in its haydays and demise.

    <div class="caption">Interesting view of the propeller during the salvage operations</div>
  </div>
</div>

The salvaging process is documented in the book SS Great Britain - transatlantic liner 1843 by Wyn Davies & Herb Schitz.  This book was a great help to get a better understanding of the history and had several pictures that was very helpful in the build.

### restored ship in shipyard

The pictures I took during our visit to the museum was particularly handy.

## The Challenge 

I am a complete novice, know very little about historic ships, have never done a scratch build, and have virtually no specialists tools. In addition, I am not a draftsman, struggle to see shapes and picture the outcome in my head.

The biggest blessing when I started off was that I had no idea of the challenges that was lying ahead.

When I look back then these challenges all awaited in the wings.

**Technical:**

- Combining iron hull appearance with available model materials
- working with different materials including plating, wood, cloth, rope, plastic
- Balancing sail and steam propulsion elements
- Achieving proper scale for intricate deck and rigging
- working with all sorts of new tools and modelling techniques
- Six-masted sailing configuration
- Running vs standing rigging differentiation
- Proper tension and scale appearance

**Research:**

- Finding accurate historical references for specific periods
- Determining authentic color schemes and markings
- Understanding the evolution of the ship through various refits

**Skills:**

- manufacturing and shaping the hull with metal finishing techniques for iron hull effects
- Scratch-building all the deck fittings and mast
- sizing, cutting and fitting the sails and flags 
- Complex rigging for multiple mast configurations
- etcheding brass work, side ports and other fine details
- Managing the minute sizes with a model that could not exceed 30 cm.

### Design choices

**historical relevance** The model must reflect the unique build of this magnificent ship
**Scratch build:** SS Great Britain model could not be larger than 30 cm. With the ship being approx 212 feet long, this converted to a scale of 1:96
**iron null** With this being the first steel hull ocean liner, it was important to build this into the model
**sail configuration** The ship has gone through various stages of sail configuration changes. The model is showing 6 sails, with chimney and double sails on each mast
**material selection** The aim as to use recycled materials, and self manufactured components, rather than buying in components.
**interiors** The interiors of the ship would not be visible.

With all of that said, the hull assembly could start. The rest of the build is described in the following sections.

## SS Great Britain Build Logs

{% assign project_logs = site.builds | where: 'project', 'ss-great-britain' | sort: 'date' %}

{% for log in project_logs %}
- **[{{ log.title }}]({{ log.url | relative_url }})**  
  *{{ log.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}* - {{ log.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}


## Techniques to Learn



2. **Complex Rigging**
   - Six-masted sailing configuration
   - Running vs standing rigging differentiation
   - Proper tension and scale appearance

3. **Steam Era Details**
   - Funnel weathering
   - Coal dust effects
   - Brass/copper fittings

4. **Mixed Construction**
   - Combining plastic kit with scratch-built details
   - Photo-etched brass enhancements
   - Wood deck overlays

## Challenges Anticipated

### Technical Challenges

**Scale Rigging:**
- Challenge: Managing complexity of six masts plus steam rigging
- Approach: Study period photos, create rigging diagram, work systematically

**Historical Accuracy:**
- Challenge: Ship had multiple configurations through her life
- Approach: Choose specific period (1845 maiden voyage configuration)

### Practical Challenges

**Time Investment:**
- This will be a long-term project (estimated 4-6 months)
- Need to maintain momentum through complex phases
- Document regularly even when progress seems slow

**Workspace:**
- Large model requires dedicated space
- Rigging phase needs room to work around entire model
- Photo setup for documentation

**Reference Management:**
- 87 reference photos need organization
- Cross-reference between plans and photos
- Track which references apply to which period

## Materials & Tools Preparation

### Ordered/Acquired:

- Revell SS Great Britain kit (1:150)
- Additional brass photo-etch detail set
- Scale rigging thread in various diameters
- Specialized ship model paints (iron oxide, coal black, etc.)
- Scribing tools for panel lines

### Still Needed:

- Brass rod for mast reinforcement
- Wood deck planking material
- Additional reference books
- Rigging blocks and deadeyes
- Display base materials

## Build Strategy

### Phased Approach:



**Phase 2: Superstructure** (Weeks 7-10)
- Deck construction
- Funnel assembly and detailing
- Deckhouse construction
- Install major fittings

**Phase 3: Masts & Rigging** (Weeks 11-16)
- Mast construction and installation
- Standing rigging first
- Running rigging systematically
- Sail installation (if including)

**Phase 4: Finishing** (Weeks 17-18)
- Final weathering
- Detail painting
- Base construction
- Photography

## Next Steps

1. **Organize References**
   - Sort 87 photos by subject (hull, rigging, details, etc.)
   - Create reference binder for workbench
   - Print key plans for easy reference

2. **Kit Inventory**
   - Open kit and inventory all parts
   - Check for damage or missing pieces
   - Wash sprues to remove mold release

3. **Workspace Setup**
   - Clear dedicated build area
   - Set up good lighting
   - Organize tools and materials
   - Prepare photo documentation setup

4. **Begin Hull Work**
   - Study hull assembly instructions
   - Test fit major hull sections
   - Plan iron plate detail approach
   - Start Build Log #002 when hull work begins

## Time Investment

**This Planning Phase:** Approximately 8-10 hours
- Research: 4 hours
- Reference gathering: 3 hours  
- Kit selection and ordering: 1 hour
- Planning and documentation: 2 hours

## Lessons from Previous Projects

Building the Gorch Fock taught me:
- Importance of thorough planning before starting
- Document as you go - memory fades quickly
- Test techniques on scrap before applying to model
- Rigging requires patience - can't be rushed
- Good references are worth the time to gather

The SS Great Britain will be more ambitious in every way, but that experience provides a foundation to build on.
