## Plant Planning

With a large part of the landscaping now prepared, and visualised, I turned my attention to finish the preparation of the plants. Each plant was individually created, positioned, and matched with the surrounding plants and available space to get a sense of the plants to make, the quantities needed to fill the space and the colour schemes.

## The Main Tree

The main tree was created by twisting copper wire. The main branches were formed from thicker copper wire, further thickened and tapered with hot glue. The thinner branches were individually twisted and then fixed to the main branches using the hot glue gun.

The tree was then spray painted with dark brown and mounted on a jig that will allow me to add the leaves.

## Leaf Application

Paper, first painted with a light green, was cut with a leaf stencil, ultimately about 3 sheets of A4 paper was used. For about two weeks the leaves were painstakingly glued to the tips of the wire, working from the bottom upwards.

## Garden Flowers

The plants and flowers were then finished off and installed around the house. Each flower is made using different techniques.
