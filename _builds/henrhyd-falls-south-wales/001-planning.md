## Initial Inspiration

It lies somewhere between: next feature challenge, materials I want to put to use, inspirational images, something or somewhere crying out for a celebration. In this case of the Henrhyd falls I was looking forward to model something with water, a natural and realistic scene from places that is well known, a new challenge. What about a waterfall, and there are many of them in Wales. I have been to some of them and Wales has stunning natural environments. A quick search lead to the discovery of Henrhyd falls, not too far from where my son lives.

I asked AI to show me how these falls can be converted to a scratch build, and it came up with this illustration.

I left the idea to chew a bit on it. Maybe another inspiration comes my way.

**Why Henrhyd Falls specifically?**
- Waterfall and river combination
- Rich nature scene with lots of different plants
- Interesting rock formations
- Close to where my son lives in Wales

**Personal Connection:**
I love nature, and waterfalls have a wonderful fascination and serenity.

**Technical Challenges to Explore:**
- First waterfall project - scratch building water is a key challenge
- Cliffs and rock formations remains ongoing challenge
- Lots of different color nuances in Welsh geology

### Research Phase

**Reference Image Gathering:**

Research started this time by asking AI for an illustrative picture. This was largely for assessing if the scale of the waterfalls will fit and work on the designated 25 × 25 cm board. Having confirmed that it is suitable, the research extended into collecting every image of the falls I could find. I did ask my son if they have been there, and if he has any pictures - unfortunately none came to light. I would have loved to visit the site, but the opportunity was not there during the build - I will visit it at some point.

In gathering the images it was necessary to get perspectives of the falls from a distance, as well as close up to see more detail. This was particularly difficult as most pictures focussed on something specific, but few were landscape related. The pictures of the rock formations were very varied in quality and focus, and this lead to a wider search of Welsh rock formations and river scenery. I wanted to have some focussed plants and trees, and had to do wider research of local plants and trees as the general pictures did not give any prominence to the general habitat around the falls.

**Resources Used:**
- Website for the falls
- YouTube for learning about making waterfalls and other waterfall builds
- Tourist and Welsh natural resources and tourist sites
- Social media for others that visited the falls
- Other diorama artists on their sites for general input

**Total: 62 reference images collected and analyzed**

### Waterfall Reference Images

![Reference waterfall in forest]({{ 'assets/images/projects/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/planning/hfs-planning-005.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Reference waterfall in lush forest setting. The serene beauty of this cascading waterfall in a secluded forest helped me understand the water flow patterns and the intimate relationship between water and surrounding vegetation.*

![Vertical waterfall drop]({{ 'assets/images/projects/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/planning/hfs-planning-007.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Waterfall oasis showing vertical drop through verdant forest. This reference image was particularly useful for understanding how the white water cascade contrasts against dark rock and green foliage.*

![Waterfall mist effects]({{ 'assets/images/projects/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/planning/hfs-planning-011.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Tranquil waterfall showing mist and spray effects at the base. This image helped me plan the water impact zone and understand how to represent the atmospheric moisture that characterizes Welsh waterfalls.*

### Henrhyd Falls Site Photos

*Henrhyd Falls with wooden bridge walkway. This photo shows the actual site with the famous wooden bridge structure and gives a sense of the scale and surrounding landscape.*

*Henrhyd Falls, Wales - showing the full height of the waterfall. This captivating view helped me understand the overall proportions and the dramatic vertical drop that defines this location.*

![Batman filming location]({{ 'assets/images/projects/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/planning/hfs-planning-030.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Henrhyd Falls Batman film location in Brecon Beacons. This reference was valuable for understanding the cave formation behind the falls - the feature that made it famous as a filming location for The Dark Knight Rises.*

### Rock Formation Studies

*Coastal rock formation showing layered sedimentary structure. While not from Henrhyd Falls itself, this majestic coastal landscape provided excellent reference for understanding Welsh geological stratification and weathering patterns.*

*Detailed cliff face texture study. This meticulously detailed view captures the intricate patterns and textures of a rugged cliff face - invaluable for planning the rock carving and texturing techniques.*

### Welsh Woodland References

*Ancient woodland tree in Welsh forest. This majestic arbor in enchanted woods shows the character of Welsh sessile oak and the moss-covered trunk texture that defines temperate rainforest environments.*

![Forest understory vegetation]({{ 'assets/images/projects/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/planning/hfs-planning-053.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Verdant forest understory vegetation. Exploring the enchanting depths of Welsh woodland helped me understand the dense, layered vegetation and the rich green palette needed for authentic representation.*

**Most Helpful Approach:**

The lack of a single definitive picture that provided everything I needed meant this diorama became an artistic representation of a range of different features, plants and scenarios. However the core recognisable imagery for a straight high fall, caves behind the falls, large trees on the top of the cliff made it unmistakably Henrhyd Falls.

## Scale Planning & Design

### Why 1:250 Scale?

Getting the right scale was important at an early stage as the whole landscape had to fit on a small board. AI was helpful in validating this and came up with the overall selection of the scale.

**Composition Planning:**

The composition was planned using the AI representation and several different photos, and then roughly sketched out on a piece of paper to get the cliff, and enough of the lower ground into the picture to make it representative.

**Base Size:**

The base size was 25 × 25 cm, and that was definitive. The selection of the model had to fit the base size.

**Challenge of Representing a 27m Waterfall:**

The waterfall height did represent a challenge. At the scale this would mean the falls had to be 10cm, there should be some lift in the landscape at the bottom of the falls, lets say about 3cm which really means a 7 meter drop for the pond and run off at the bottom, and the rocky mountain where the river cuts through of about 5cm which represents approx 12m above the cut through and therefore approx 45 meter cliff from bottom to the top of the rocks - about 18cm high model overall.

Although the AI calculations of the side profile for the falls were helpful, it was actually incorrect and did not include the elevation above the falls, and the slope at the bottom of the falls.

### Vertical Cliff Structure Planning

It was important to maintain the cave behind the waterfall as it is unique to these falls. From the images it was evident that the cliff is concave with clear rock faces almost forming a theatre.

## Key Planning Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **AI Concept Validation:** The AI illustration immediately confirmed the project was feasible at 1:250 scale
2. **Comprehensive Research:** Collecting 62 images across multiple categories provided rich reference material
3. **Multiple Source Integration:** No single definitive image meant creating an artistic representation from range of features
4. **Scale Calculations:** Working through the vertical requirements (18cm total height) validated the ambitious scope

### Critical Discoveries

1. **AI Limitations:** The AI side profile missed key elevation details (slope at bottom, terrain above falls)
2. **Reference Gaps:** Most images focused on specific elements rather than landscape composition
3. **Research Breadth Required:** Extended search beyond Henrhyd Falls to Welsh geology and woodland generally
4. **Cave Feature Essential:** The concave cliff with cave behind falls is the signature feature - must be preserved

## Next Steps

With planning complete, construction moves to:

1. **Base Construction** - Create 25×25cm foundation with 18cm vertical structure
2. **Rock Cliff Formation** - Carve and texture the concave cliff face with cave
3. **Waterfall Creation** - Build the 10cm drop with realistic water effects
4. **Welsh Woodland** - Add authentic temperate rainforest vegetation
