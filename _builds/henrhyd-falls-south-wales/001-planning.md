## Current Build Stage

**Phase:** Planning & Research  
**Focus:** Photographic reference collection, scale planning, and composition design

## Work Completed

- **Location Research:** Studied Henrhyd Falls (27m drop, tallest in South Wales)
- **Photographic References:** Collected 42 reference images organized by category
- **Scale Planning:** Established 1:250 scale on 25cm × 25cm base
- **Composition Design:** Created top-down plan with AI design assistance
- **Material Planning:** Identified techniques for waterfall, rocks, and Welsh woodland

## Research Summary

### Location Details

- **Real Height:** 27 meters (tallest in South Wales)
- **Diorama Scale:** 1:250 (waterfall = ~11cm)
- **Base Size:** 25cm × 25cm (representing 62.5m × 62.5m area)
- **Setting:** Graig Llech Gorge, Brecon Beacons National Park

### Key Design Elements

1. **Waterfall Placement:** Center-top with 16cm wide cliff section
2. **Stream Path:** Diagonal flow from pool to bottom-left with rocky cascades
3. **Hidden Pathway:** Curves from mid-right to top-right behind falls
4. **Vegetation Zones:** Dense tree clusters for framing (top and right edges)
5. **Rock Features:** Large boulders on left for elevation contrast

### Ecological Character

The Henrhyd gorge supports a rare UK temperate rainforest microclimate:

- **Trees:** Sessile oak, ash (canopy), alder and willow (riverbanks)
- **Ground Cover:** Mosses, liverworts, ferns, wood sorrel, wild garlic, seasonal bluebells
- **Epiphytes:** Lichens and mosses on trunks/rocks (indicate clean air, high humidity)

## Techniques to Employ

### Water Effects
- Resin casting for waterfall flow
- Clear gloss medium for wet rocks
- Cotton batting for spray/mist effects
- Layered transparency for depth

### Rock Formation
- Carved foam with plaster coating
- Layered sedimentary texture
- Moss and lichen effects with static grass and ground foam
- Weathering for aged Welsh stone

### Woodland Vegetation
- Wire armature trees (sessile oak, ash)
- Natural materials (dried ferns, moss)
- Scale-appropriate foliage
- Temperate rainforest moisture effects

## Materials & Tools Research

### Materials Identified
- Extruded polystyrene foam (cliff structure)
- Plaster or sculptamold (rock coating)
- Clear casting resin (water effects)
- Wire armatures (tree trunks)
- Woodland scenic materials (Woodland Scenics, natural collected materials)
- Static grass (moss and ground cover)

### Reference Count
- **AI Design:** 4 conceptual images
- **Waterfall/Water:** 8 reference images
- **Landscape Views:** 22 reference images
- **Rock/Cliff:** 11 reference images
- **Trees/Woodland:** 17 reference images
- **Total:** 62 planning references

## Next Steps

Moving from planning to construction:

1. **Base Construction** - Create 25cm × 25cm foundation with cliff structure
2. **Rock Cliff Formation** - Carve and texture vertical terrain
3. **Waterfall Structure** - Build the 11cm drop with pool at base
4. **Initial Vegetation** - Begin Welsh woodland character

**Estimated Completion:** November 2025

## Time Investment

**This Session:** Approximately 15-20 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Location research and history: 3 hours
- Photographic reference collection: 8 hours
- Scale calculations and planning: 4 hours
- AI design exploration: 3 hours
- Material research: 2 hours

**Total Project Time So Far:** 15-20 hours

**Status:** Planning complete, ready for construction  
**Next Log:** Base construction and cliff structure foundation  
**Estimated Next Update:** October 2025
