## Project conceptualisation

Cathy's flower house kit introduced me to the skill of making small plants, and I love plants.  I was all fired up to make some trees, and all sorts of plants.  With the encouragement of the internet, I then decided to create a log cabin - seeing that i have quite a bit of bamboo available. I first had to figure out how large it should be, and put some plans together. 

## Project Start

I started the Log Cabin in the Woods project on January 20, 2024. This scratch-build diorama focuses on creating an authentic rustic cabin from without a kit.  It would be set within a natural woodland environment at 1:35 scale.

20 mm Styrofoam seemed just the right material for the base, and setting the cabin again the backdrop of a rocky cliff lead to pieces of styrofoam being glued together into the bare shape of the cliff.  I quickly realised that it would need some support for the cliff and added a thin plywood backing for this. measuring the footprint of the cabin in relation to the cliff, allowed me to size the cabin and built it from paper and cardboard to get a perspective of its height and layout.

## Preparing the base

Mixing a paste of flour, PVA glue and water, with a bit of vinigar and cooking oil, then covered the foam with layers and let it dry.  It did crack badly, most likely because of the composition on the paste mix, but I kept filling in the cracks until it hardened off.

## Constructing the cabin


## Planning and Materials

Initial planning involved:
- Researching authentic log cabin construction techniques.  The plan was to use bamboo and other materials in and around the house.
- Gathering reference images of traditional cabin architecture
- Planning the cabin dimensions and layout
- Sketching the basic structure
- Building a prototype to visualise the scale and positioning.

Key materials for cabin construction:
- Basswood strips and dowels for logs
- Balsa wood for roof structure
- Stone-textured material for chimney
- Fine sandpaper for weathering
- Acrylic paints in earth tones
- Wood stains and washes

## Phase 1: Foundation and Base Logs

<div class="image-row-2">
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-001.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Initial foundation work">
    <p class="image-caption">Initial foundation and base log preparation - establishing the cabin footprint</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-002.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Base logs assembled">
    <p class="image-caption">First course of logs assembled with corner notching</p>
  </div>
</div>

The foundation was laid first, establishing the cabin's footprint. Each log was individually shaped from basswood, with bark texture carved into the surface. Corner notching was carefully cut to interlock the logs authentically.

## Phase 2: Wall Construction

<div class="image-row-2">
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-003.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Wall building progress">
    <p class="image-caption">Walls taking shape with multiple log courses</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-004.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Wall assembly detail">
    <p class="image-caption">Detail of log assembly and corner construction</p>
  </div>
</div>

Building the walls required patience and precision. Each log was:
- Cut to length with slight variations for realism
- Bark texture carved along the length
- Edges chamfered slightly for weathered appearance
- Stained with various wood tones for natural variation
- Fitted and glued in place with corner notches aligned

    <p class="image-caption">Window and door openings integrated into wall structure</p>
  </div>
</div>

Window and door openings were left as the walls built up, with frame pieces added to support the structure around these gaps.

## Phase 3: Roof Structure

<div class="image-row-2">
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-007.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Roof frame assembly">
    <p class="image-caption">Roof frame taking shape with rafters in place</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-008.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Roof structure progress">
    <p class="image-caption">Roof structure nearing completion</p>
  </div>
</div>

The roof structure was built with:
- Ridge beam running the length of the cabin
- Individual rafters spaced evenly
- Cross bracing for stability
- Roof boards laid perpendicular to rafters
- Shingle material prepared for application

## Phase 4: Roof Completion and Chimney

<div class="image-row-2">
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-009.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Roof with shingles">
    <p class="image-caption">Completed roof with weathered shingles applied</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-build1-010.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Cabin with chimney">
    <p class="image-caption">Cabin structure complete with stone chimney and porch posts</p>
  </div>
</div>

Final structural elements included:
- Individual shingles cut and applied row by row
- Weathering applied to shingles with washes and dry brushing
- Stone chimney built from textured material with mortar lines
- Front porch posts added with supporting beams
- Initial weathering applied to entire structure

## Build Reflections

### What Worked Well
- Individual log construction gave authentic appearance
- Corner notching technique created realistic joints
- Variation in wood tones added natural character
- Roof structure method was sturdy and realistic

### Challenges Encountered
- Maintaining consistent log diameter while adding texture
- Aligning corner notches precisely for tight fit
- Keeping walls level as height increased
- Individual shingles were time-intensive but worth the effort

### Skills Developed
- Fine detail carving for bark texture
- Scale woodworking techniques
- Building structural elements from scratch
- Weathering and aging wood surfaces

## Time Investment

**Total cabin construction time:** Approximately 40-45 hours
- Planning and material prep: 5 hours
- Foundation and base logs: 8 hours
- Wall construction: 18 hours
- Roof structure and shingles: 12 hours
- Chimney and details: 6 hours

## Next Steps

With the cabin structure complete, the next phase focuses on preparing natural vegetation and plant materials that will populate the woodland environment around the cabin.
