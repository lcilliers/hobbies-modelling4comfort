## Scenery Construction Phase

With the cabin structure complete and vegetation materials prepared, this phase focused on building the terrain base and integrating all elements into a cohesive woodland environment. The goal was to create a natural-looking forest setting that seamlessly incorporated the cabin as if it had always been there.

## Terrain Base Construction

The base was built on a sturdy wooden platform measuring 30cm x 25cm:
- Foam core layers shaped for elevation changes
- Carved pathways and clearings around cabin
- Textured surface for natural ground appearance
- Strategic placement points marked for trees and vegetation

## Phase 1: Base Terrain Shaping

  </div>
</div>

Terrain shaping involved:
- Multiple foam layers glued and stacked
- Hot wire cutting for smooth contours
- Carving texture into foam surface
- Creating natural slopes and elevation changes
- Hollowing areas for tree root integration

The cabin was test-fitted multiple times to ensure:
- Level placement despite terrain contours
- Natural integration with ground level
- Space for surrounding vegetation
- Proper visual composition

## Phase 2: Ground Texturing

    <p class="image-caption">Building up layers of ground texture and leaf litter</p>
  </div>
</div>

Ground texturing was built in layers:

**Base Layer:**
- Diluted PVA glue brushed over entire surface
- Fine sand and soil mixture sprinkled while wet
- Multiple coats for solid, durable base
- Allowed to dry completely between coats

**Secondary Texturing:**
- Coarser sand and small gravel in pathway areas
- Fine turf fibers in grassy areas
- Darker earth tones near cabin for trampled look
- Stone texture added with small pebbles

**Organic Material:**
- Crushed dried leaves for forest floor litter
- Small bark chips for natural debris
- Scattered seed pods and tiny twigs
- Fine sawdust for decomposed organic layer

## Phase 3: Tree Placement

    <p class="image-caption">Forest environment building up around the cabin</p>
  </div>
</div>

Tree placement was carefully considered:
- Larger trees positioned in background for depth
- Trees placed in natural-looking groups, not evenly spaced
- Varying heights to create forest canopy levels
- Some trees angled for natural growth patterns
- Dead trees added for realistic forest variety

Installation method:
1. Drill hole in base slightly smaller than tree root wire
2. Insert tree and test positioning
3. Remove and fill hole with thick PVA glue
4. Reinsert tree and support until glue sets
5. Add scenic glue around base
6. Cover with ground materials to hide join

## Phase 4: Undergrowth and Vegetation

    <p class="image-caption">Building up dense vegetation in shadowed forest areas</p>
  </div>
</div>

Undergrowth was added strategically:
- Dense vegetation in background and sides
- Lighter vegetation near pathways and cabin
- Bush materials for medium-height plants
- Fine static grass for ground-level growth
- Moss patches on rocks and shaded areas

Application techniques:
- Scenic glue applied with brush or dropper
- Materials sprinkled or positioned with tweezers
- Multiple layers built up for depth
- Colors varied from dark green to brown
- Dead leaves scattered for forest floor realism

## Phase 5: Integration and Details

  </div>
</div>

Final scenery details included:
- Fallen logs and branches on forest floor
- Rock outcroppings partially buried in earth
- Pathway dirt lighter where foot traffic would occur
- Vegetation growing up against cabin walls
- Moss and lichen on cabin's north side
- Small mushroom clusters in shaded areas

    <p class="image-caption">Overall scene composition with cabin nestled in woods</p>
  </div>
</div>

Edge treatment:
- Terrain edges blended to base edge
- Darker colors used at edges to suggest forest continues
- No hard lines between elements
- Natural transition from cleared area to dense forest

## Scenery Composition Principles

Several principles guided the scenery building:

**Depth and Perspective:**
- Larger elements in foreground
- Smaller, less detailed elements in background
- Darker colors toward rear
- Denser vegetation at edges

**Natural Randomness:**
- Avoided symmetrical placement
- Varied tree heights and spacing
- Mixed vegetation types throughout
- Random scatter of ground materials

**Visual Balance:**
- Cabin positioned off-center for interest
- Trees frame but don't overwhelm cabin
- Open areas contrast with dense forest
- Eye naturally drawn to cabin

**Scale Consistency:**
- All vegetation sized appropriately for 1:35 scale
- Ground materials fine enough to maintain scale
- Tree heights proportional to cabin
- Details visible but not oversized

## Build Reflections

### What Worked Well
- Layered approach to ground texturing created realistic depth
- Strategic tree placement framed cabin effectively
- Natural materials brought instant authenticity
- Varied vegetation types prevented monotonous appearance

### Challenges Encountered
- Balancing detail density - knowing when to stop adding materials
- Maintaining scale consistency with natural materials
- Working around already-placed trees to add undergrowth
- Preventing glue from showing through ground cover

### Skills Developed
- Terrain building and contouring
- Composition and visual balance
- Working with natural materials at scale
- Layering techniques for realistic ground texture

## Time Investment

**Total scenery building time:** Approximately 45-50 hours
- Base terrain shaping: 8 hours
- Ground texturing (multiple layers): 12 hours
- Tree placement and installation: 10 hours
- Undergrowth and vegetation: 15 hours
- Integration and detail work: 8 hours

## Next Steps

With the scenery constructed and the cabin integrated into its woodland environment, the final phase focuses on weathering, finishing touches, and bringing the entire scene together into a cohesive completed diorama.
