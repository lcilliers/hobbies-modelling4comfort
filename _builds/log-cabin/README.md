## Build Documentation Moved

The complete build process for the Log Cabin in the Woods project has been incorporated into the main project page as a comprehensive narrative with 9 detailed chapters.

**[View the complete Log Cabin project story →]({{ '/projects/log-cabin/' | relative_url }})**

The project page includes:
- Full build narrative from concept to completion
- 9 chronological chapters covering all construction phases
- 42 integrated build process images
- 8-image gallery of the finished diorama
- Detailed techniques and materials documentation

This consolidation provides a better reading experience with the complete story in one place, rather than fragmented across multiple build log entries.
