## Natural Materials Phase

With the cabin structure complete, focus shifted to preparing the vegetation and natural materials that would bring the woodland environment to life. This phase involved collecting, processing, and preparing various plant materials to create realistic scaled trees, undergrowth, and forest floor details.

## Material Collection

Natural materials were collected from:
- Local woodland areas for small twigs and branches
- Garden prunings for fine branching structures
- Dried flowers and seed heads for foliage texture
- Moss and lichen specimens
- Fine grasses and stems

All materials were selected for:
- Appropriate scale when reduced to 1:35
- Structural integrity after drying
- Natural branching patterns
- Texture variety

## Phase 1: Tree Preparation

</div>

Tree preparation involved several steps:
- Selecting twigs with natural branching patterns
- Removing excess bark and smoothing trunks
- Trimming branches to appropriate scale
- Creating root systems from twisted wire and finer twigs
- Reinforcing delicate branches with thin wire

Each tree was built individually with attention to:
- Realistic trunk taper
- Natural branch distribution
- Appropriate height for the scale
- Stability for placement in the diorama

## Phase 2: Foliage Processing

    <p class="image-caption">Breaking down and grading foliage materials by texture</p>
  </div>
</div>

Foliage materials were processed by:
- Drying thoroughly to prevent decay
- Breaking into appropriately scaled pieces
- Sorting by texture and color
- Treating with diluted PVA to seal and strengthen
- Storing by type for easy access during scenery building

Material types prepared included:
- **Fine foliage**: For tree canopies and dense vegetation
- **Ground cover**: Various textures for forest floor
- **Undergrowth**: Medium-scale plants and bushes
- **Dead vegetation**: Brown and grey materials for forest litter

## Phase 3: Tree Assembly

    <p class="image-caption">Group of completed trees ready for foliage application</p>
  </div>
</div>

Tree assembly process:
1. Select main trunk with good taper and character
2. Drill small holes at natural branch points
3. Insert and glue secondary branches using CA glue
4. Add finer twigs to branch tips for realistic detail
5. Paint trunk and branches with bark colors
6. Apply washes to enhance texture and depth
7. Add foliage using scenic adhesive or hairspray
8. Seal entire tree with matte varnish

Different tree types were created:
- **Tall pines**: Slender trunks with upward-reaching branches
- **Deciduous trees**: Broader canopies with spreading branches
- **Dead trees**: Bare branches for variety and realism
- **Saplings**: Smaller, younger-looking trees

## Preparation Techniques

### Drying and Preservation
All plant materials underwent preservation:
- Air dried in dark, dry location to prevent color fade
- Treated with glycerin solution for flexibility retention
- Sealed with diluted PVA (white glue) after drying
- Stored in labeled containers by material type

### Color Treatment
Some materials received color enhancement:
- Light green spray for spring foliage
- Brown washes for dead leaves
- Grey dry brushing for weathered wood
- Natural moss colors preserved through careful drying

### Texture Variation
Multiple material types ensure variety:
- Coarse materials for pine needles
- Fine materials for deciduous leaves
- Clumped materials for bushes and undergrowth
- Loose materials for ground scatter

## Material Inventory

By the end of this phase, prepared materials included:
- 8 main tree armatures with varying heights (5-12cm)
- 15 smaller sapling/bush armatures
- Multiple containers of sorted foliage material
- Ground cover materials in 5 different textures
- Dead wood pieces for forest floor details
- Moss and lichen specimens

## Build Reflections

### What Worked Well
- Natural materials provided instant realism
- Variety in collection gave options during scenery building
- Pre-treating materials prevented future deterioration
- Organizing by type made later work more efficient

### Challenges Encountered
- Finding branches at appropriate scale required extensive searching
- Some materials proved too fragile after drying
- Color changes during drying weren't always predictable
- Storage and organization of many small components

### Skills Developed
- Plant material selection and evaluation
- Preservation and sealing techniques
- Tree armature construction
- Natural material organization and workflow

## Time Investment

**Total plant preparation time:** Approximately 25-30 hours
- Collection of materials: 8 hours
- Cleaning and initial processing: 6 hours
- Tree armature building: 10 hours
- Preservation and treatment: 4 hours
- Organization and storage: 2 hours

## Next Steps

With a comprehensive collection of prepared vegetation and tree structures, the next phase focuses on building the terrain base and integrating these natural elements into the woodland scenery around the cabin.
