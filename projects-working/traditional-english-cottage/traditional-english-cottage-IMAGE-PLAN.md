**Note:** Some planning images not used in main narrative (only 30 of 32)
to avoid redundancy. Remaining 2 can be referenced if needed.

**Gallery Images:** These are placed in the narrative for context but will
also appear in the automatic gallery section generated by the Jekyll template.

**Next Step:** Human must review actual photo content and adjust image markers
to match what each photo actually shows. Current markers are placeholders
based on folder organization and chronology.
