---

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Expand the Source Narrative (Priority 1)

**File to Edit:** `traditional-english-cottage-SOURCE-NARRATIVE.md`

**Required Actions:**
1. Read through all [NEEDS MORE] and [TODO] sections
2. Fill in your personal narrative for each build phase:
   - What did you do?
   - Why did you make those choices?
   - What challenges did you face?
   - How did you solve problems?
   - What did you learn?

3. Verify all [AI-CHECK] sections:
   - Confirm timeline is accurate
   - Verify technical details
   - Correct any AI assumptions

4. Add specific details:
   - Actual scale used
   - Dimensions of finished piece
   - Hours invested in each phase
   - Materials list
   - Tools used
   - Personal experiences and memories

5. Mark completed sections as [COMPLETE]

**Goal:** Transform the template into YOUR authentic story in your own words.

---

### Step 2: Review Organized Narrative (Priority 2)

**File to Edit:** `traditional-english-cottage-SOURCE-NARRATIVE-ORGANIZED.md`

**Required Actions:**
1. Read through the chapter structure
2. Ensure chapters flow logically
3. Expand all [NEEDS MORE] sections
4. Add transitional text between sections
5. Confirm timeline markers match your actual work

**Goal:** Create a well-structured narrative ready for image integration.

---

### Step 3: Review Image Placement (Priority 3)

**File to Review:** `traditional-english-cottage-IMAGE-PLAN.md`

**Required Actions:**
1. Look at actual photos in source folders
2. Verify image markers match photo content
3. Adjust markers if photos show different content
4. Move image markers if better placement exists
5. Remove any markers for redundant photos
6. Decide which photos to actually use (may not need all 116)

**Goal:** Ensure image markers accurately reflect photo content.

---

### Step 4: Select and Optimize Photos (Priority 4)

**Required Actions:**
1. Review all 116 source photos
2. Decide which photos to use for the site
   - You may not want all planning photos
   - Select best shots from each phase
   - Choose strongest gallery images

3. Optimize selected photos:
   - Resize for web (600-800px for process, 1200-1600px for gallery)
   - Compress appropriately
   - Save to Web-Optimized folders with target filenames
   - Preserve folder structure

**Tools:**
- ImageMagick (see IMAGEMAGICK-GUIDE.md)
- Batch scripts available in scripts/ folder
- Manual optimization with your preferred tool

**Important:** Do NOT move original source photos. Only create optimized copies in Web-Optimized folders.

---

### Step 5: Create Build Log Files (After Narrative Complete)

Once narrative is validated, create separate build log markdown files:
- `_builds/traditional-english-cottage-planning.md`
- `_builds/traditional-english-cottage-build1-cottage.md`
- `_builds/traditional-english-cottage-build2-base.md`
- `_builds/traditional-english-cottage-build3-plants.md`
- `_builds/traditional-english-cottage-build4-finalisation.md`

Each build log should:
- Extract content from corresponding chapter
- Include relevant images for that phase
- Use proper front matter
- Link to main project page

---

### Step 6: Convert to Final Markdown (After Validation)

**File to Create:** Update `_projects/traditional-english-cottage.md`

**Required Actions:**
1. Convert [IMAGE: filename] markers to proper markdown syntax:
   - `[IMAGE: tec-build1-001.jpg]` becomes  
   - `![Caption](/assets/images/projects/traditional-english-cottage/tec-build1-001.jpg)`

2. Add front matter with gallery array:
   ```yaml
   gallery:
     - /assets/images/projects/traditional-english-cottage/tec-gallery-001.jpg
     - /assets/images/projects/traditional-english-cottage/tec-gallery-002.jpg
     [etc...]
   ```

3. Ensure pure markdown (no HTML tags)
4. Add captions and context for each image
5. Remove all validation markers ([COMPLETE], [NEEDS MORE], etc.)
6. Update published: true when ready

---

## Important Reminders

### Following the Methodology

All work has been prepared following **SOURCE-NARRATIVE-METHODOLOGY.md** guidelines:

✅ **Content Validation Framework Applied:**
- [COMPLETE] sections are from verified sources (Architecture.txt)
- [AI-CHECK] sections need your verification
- [NEEDS MORE] sections need your expansion
- [TODO] sections need your creation

✅ **Provenance Tracking:**
- All files include provenance headers
- Content sources clearly marked
- AI-organized vs. human-authored clearly distinguished

✅ **Human Review Workflow:**
- Template created (Step 1-4: Done)
- Human expansion needed (Step 5: YOU)
- AI structuring complete (already done)
- Human validation required (Step 6: YOU)
- Final conversion awaits validation (Step 7: after YOU complete)

### Critical Points

**❌ DO NOT:**
- Publish until all [NEEDS MORE] sections completed
- Move or delete source photos
- Skip validation of [AI-CHECK] sections
- Assume timeline from photo dates is accurate without verification

**✅ DO:**
- Write in your own authentic voice
- Include personal experiences and memories
- Document challenges and solutions
- Share learning moments
- Verify all technical details
- Mark validated sections as [COMPLETE]

### Files You Should NOT Edit Yet
