## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION

This project was selected as an in-between project, mainly to make something with the bamboo and to practice and experiment with making figures.  I also wanted to experiment with a different type of base and had a small soap container that was staring me in the face and begging to be used.  I also knew we are heading towards our grand daughter for Christmas and it would lovely to add something to her miniature world of dol houses and micro dolls.

## lookout

having said that I searched for photos of a nice lookout cabin and found this one.

I first sorted the bamboo sections in to diameters, and cut sheets from heavy paper to serve as the basis of the walls, floor and roof.  The sticks were then all glued to the paper bases, and shaped to form the floor, walls, door and window and patio around the unit.

 The walls were then all framed inside thicker bamboo that served as the uprights to hold the walls together.  The roof was covered by actual dried bamboo leaves glued onto the roof and painted with clear matt varnish to preserve it and keep it in place. small pieces of hessien rope was glued on top add the detail of roof tie downs.

The final touch was to create the railings. a top and bottom railing was drilled with exact gaps and then thin bamboo was glued into the holes and fitted top and bottom.  The railings were then fixed to the patio.

with the lookout completed, I could turn my attention to the river, and figures to provide more interest.

## figures

I previously had real trouble making the heads and decided to first make the head, and then use it on a body. although it was an improvement on my previous attempts, I then turned my attention to making a wireframe and layered the air dry clay onto the frame.

I created a small holder to put the wireframe in to avoid putting pressure on the clay while holding it.

following is a series of different figures I made. To the left was a plastic figure bought in, and painted, to get a better appreciation of the proportions. Second from the left was the air dry clay, that I painted (and it then flaked) - this was heading in the right direction. On the right was figures from epoxy putty, and previous generations of attempts. The proportions and face was just off.

The girl for my model was coming together, although the face need more work.

After giving up the get the detail of the figures right, I put them in the over to try, and then gave them a undercoats.

after painting the figures, they did not come out completely rubbish, but I realised I still have a long way to go

## final touches

after completing the figures, stairs were added into the river, the base was filled and painted to resemble the water and plants where added.  A fishing rod with line from a bead of hotglue, a bucket and even a fish was added.

this build provided the opportunity to do more practice, especially with a focus on getting detail right.  It also illustrate that I still have a long way to go.  I need more patience, more technique, the right material, and not give up too early.

On the other hand, I also learnt that I can improvise, and have great ideas to guide me on the road.

The small tools for holding the figures were great, except that the hotglue fixing did not work for putting the models into the oven.
