## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION

[Document the story of this commission:
- How did the commission come about?
- What was the client's vision or request?
- What inspired the caravan camping theme?
- What were the specific requirements or constraints?
- What excited you most about this project?
- How did this compare to previous builds?]

With the English country garden completed, I was looking for inspiration for the next module.  One evening in Nov 2024 I was relaxing with my Son and family, and in a jest asked 'So do you have anything that I can build for you' - being over confident of my newly discovered skills with the building of the garden.  'Yes' they say, 'Can you build our new caravan and car on a campsite next to a river'. And that was it.

This meant I needed to figure out how to make a model of a Eriba Triton caravan, and a VW golf estate - in red.  It must feature my Son and Daughter and Tilly, their beloved dog. Obviously on a camp site next to a river in Wales.  Previously, mo modelling of figures were not very successful, especially if it must resemble the owner; never models miniature animals; never attempted to model any type of vehicle; and the first river I made in the log cabin was not nearly realistic.  There was lots to learn, lots to discover, and perhaps too ambitious. The planning phase started.

## CHAPTER 1: PLANNING AND RESEARCH
**Timeline:** Dec 2023

### Initial Concept and Client Brief

The key features of the model were
- Must fit on a 25 cm * 25 cm base. This was dictated by the space on the designated shelf in my Son's house.
- Feature a realistic Eriba Triton Caravan
- VW golf estate in read 
- 2 realistic figures and a dog
- camping in a capsite with lawn or grass sites
- be located near a river in the backdrop
- have vegetation and plants from a Welsh rural area

### Scale and Layout Planning
I managed to get the key measurements of the caravan from the internet, and converted it to a detailed scale worksheet.  It all worked out to a scale of 1:42

caravan conversion table in mm
dimension	Scale	Actual
Body Length	100	4210
overall length	125	5280
Width	48	2000
height	54	2260

The related dimensions then:

flowerhead		width	1	40

## Caravan build

Building a replica of actual caravan turned out to be a daunting task, and I decided to tackle this first. If this failed, I would not attempt the rest of the challenge.

Fortunately there were lots of photos on the internet of the Eriba, although I could not find many other models to use as examples.  Unfortunately I could not find any model building plans, nor kit models. however, I did find a picture of a model that someone built
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-027.jpeg

I selected photos from the research to show the different views.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-024.jpg

I also visited the campsite of my children to get a better understanding of the caravan and car in situ.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-028.jpg

One of the side view pictures were used to get the angles for the front and the rear.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\planning\caravaning-planning-003.jpg

Finding detail measurements were very handy.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-001.jpg

with all the information at hand, a rough cutting sheet drawing was made.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\planning\caravaning-planning-002.jpg

The tree layers of body were cut out of balsawood, and then spaced to get the correct height from floor to centre, and centre to top with some more blasawood.  The body was then covered and shaped with the appropriate angles using Milliput two part epoxy putty. After hardening the body was further shaped with files and sanders. As you can see in the picture, I had to do several adjustments to get the angles representative. A undercoat was applied to assist with the finish of the body.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-002.jpg

Next was to make all the windows.  The windows was first cut out of hard wood to get a visual check and serve as a template for bending 1.5 black coated alluminium wire to form the window frames. Another frame was added in each window from .5 mm allumnium wire to represent the inner window frame. Transparent hard plastic was cut to size and glued on the insite for the window panes.  The curtains were made of painted tissue paper and glued on the transparent plastic to show the curtains through the windows. three layers of bamboo were fit into each other for the inner hub and rim of the wheels with the middle cut away to form the spokes.  A black paper strip was glued on the form the tyres. 
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-004.jpg 

The axle was glued onto the wheels.  The front nose windows was particularly hard to form given the very odd curved shape.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-005.jpg

The mud guards and rear bumper and lights were formed with the epoxy putty, and the roof was cut and sanded from balsawood. All the windows could now be glued into place.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-006.jpg

after several attempts to paint and smooth the body, I ripped to windows off, and started again with sanding the body down.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-008.jpg

It finally all came together with the jocky wheel, break and tow bar fitted on the front.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-011.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-023.jpg

Next I was tempted to use the red golf that I bought in as a model car instead of making another one.  There was just two issues, the car was not at the same scale as the caravan, and the car was not an estate.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\caravan\caravaning-caravan-026.jpeg

The temptation was quickly put aside, and the next major journey started - to make the car.

## VW Golf Estate

I found a nice picture of exactly the car I wanted
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-001.jpg
The only problem is that, even after searching all over, I just could not find a model in the right scale of an estate. The only way out is to make it.  I did buy a VW golf, to help with shaping and sizing the parts.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-007.jpg
With the help of more pictures of estates, I could visually make the adjustments needed.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-010.jpg

First for the measurement
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-002.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-003.jpg

then for paper cutting out the body. It is exactly at this point, when comparing it to my read painted model, that my heart sank into my shoes - how am going to get this right.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-009.jpg
The standard sedan looked so good with the caravan - why not use the model.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-005.jpg

It is then that I discovered air dry clay, and saw a way forward.  The epoxy was just too difficult to work with I thought that using the air dry clay would be much more palatable. bulking out the indside I then started to cover and form the body
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-006.jpg

it started to come together.  with the lights formed from hot glue, and the windows from plastic painted black on the inside. The number plate was made from yellow paper, with the correct number plate of the car.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\car\caravaning-car-008.jpg

The process did not go without disasters, and reworks.  I took apart all the fittings several times to reshape, re-sand, re-paint the body to get in smoother and shaped better. One thing is for sure, my attitude of 'good enough' was tested again and again, and patience and edurance stretch to the limit. 

with the car and the caravan ready, I could turn my attention to the scenery and other key requirements, such as the figures and Tilly, the dog.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-002.jpg

## Scenery

Up till now, I really struggled to make figures with the epoxy putty.  With the air dry clay, I thought it would be a breeze.  I first created the wire frame, rolle the clay and then started to form the bodies.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\figures\caravaning-figures-007.jpg
it should be easy 
assets\images\projects\caravaning\figures\caravaning-figures-009.jpg
Oh deer, it is harder than I thought.
assets/images/projects/caravaning/figures/caravaning-scenary-004-figures.jpg
more work with a router helped a bit, but I realised, I still have a long way to go with figures.

My first attempt to make Tilly the dog was also poor. So I tried to carve it out of wood.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\figures\caravaning-figures-004.jpg
there was defintely an improvement.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\figures\caravaning-figures-005.jpg
and all the units seemed somehow in proportion and in shape.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\figures\caravaning-figures-013.jpeg

The final figures did not come out too bad.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\gallery\caravaning-gallery-009.jpg

##positioning 

with the main parts in place, I could start to get a perspective of positioning on the board.  I realised that my initial idea of having a path, and fence into the campsite is just not feasible, and that their is just not enough scope for having the canopy of the caravan pitched.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-004.jpg

## time for making the plants.

assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-007.jpg

with my newly designed drying clamps, and repurposed credit card leaf and flower dryer pads i started to build out the shrubs and plants next to the river.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-009.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-008.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-011.jpg

Before starting with the larger trees, I re-assessed different trees in the wild
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-018.jpg
then larger trees and shrubs where first wired
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-010.jpg
and then the leaving of the main tree started
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-013.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-021.jpeg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-015.jpg
Before finishing the grass, I first had a good look at various open space scenes in the caravan parks
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-019.jpg
for the first time , I used a static grass applicator to create the green grass around the caravan 
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-014.jpg
the finer detail around the river was added after having a good look at river scenes. The river itself was painted, and then covered with a layer of clear resin to finish it off.
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-020.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\scenary\caravaning-scenary-016.jpg

assets\images\projects\caravaning\gallery\caravaning-gallery-006.jpg
assets\images\projects\caravaning\gallery\caravaning-gallery-010.jpg

after finishing all the plants and terrain, the caravan model looked very good amongst its peers on the model table.
