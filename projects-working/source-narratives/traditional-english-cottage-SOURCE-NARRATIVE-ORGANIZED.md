# Traditional English Cottage - Organized Narrative

## Project Overview


Add opening paragraphs that introduce:
- The project inspiration and goals
  
This project has in interesting and odd origination.  After completing the caravaning project, thoughts were going around on what next.  I did not want to tackle another commission and continued  to be facinated by scratch building. I eventually decided to trawl through all our photos to see if some inspiration will jump out.  I came accross this photo of a beautiful countryside house and noticed that the photo was taken by my wife when we had a country side drive in the Meon valley, Hampshire, UK in 2017.  The photo was ideal with great features.

- What made you choose a traditional English cottage
This cottage was an excellent representation of the building style in the region, especially the flintstone which is unique for this area. 

- Your vision for the finished piece
The finished piece would be representative of the house, and setting adjacent to the road.  Because no other photos of the back of the house, and the garden is available, artistic freedom will be used to round off the cottage at the back, the garden layout and plants.

- Brief overview of the journey ahead

a key challenge was to visualise and structure a 3d model from a 2d image.  I attempted to scan the 2d house into a Meshy AI to convert it. It came up with some interesting representations of the other side of the house that is not in the photo.  Using the views from the different angles that Meshy came up with was very handy.  However, I did manage to go one step further to create  full scaled drawings electronically, my skills just did not allow for it.

Meshy perspective of the different sides of the house.

Failing to prepare drawings, I decided to make each wall and facade separately, with reference to the Meshy images, constantly fitting them together to confirm the measurements and design.

many elements of this particular task ahead would be firsts for me:
- designing something in 3d from a 2d picture
- the asphalt road
- the fence with wired mesh
- gravel garden paths
- brick and flint stone walls
- tile cladding against the walls
- multi facaded roof structure
- ornate gables on the roof and rounded tiled ridges
- rose bush
- lawn around the house
- framed windows

I also wanted to achieve improvements in the accuracy of different types of plants and improve the main tree.

Finally, I wanted to change the angle of the piece on the base and use cutout (not using an entire fenced property)

## Chapter 1: Architectural Research and Planning
**Timeline: September 2025**  
**Source Folder:** `planning/` 

### [COMPLETE] Architectural Style Selection

The house design is based on a traditional English cottage, characterized by distinctive architectural features typical of southern English countryside:

- Steeply pitched gable roof
- Brick and flint walls (characteristic of Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent)
- Decorative brickwork around windows and doors
- Cottage garden with flowers and wooden fencing

The use of flint and brick is particularly common in areas where flint is naturally abundant, creating that authentic southern English appearance.

- When and why did you start researching this style?
- Sept 2025
- the why is explained above
  
- What specific aspects of English cottages appealed to you?
  see above

- Did you visit any real cottages or use specific reference materials?
I did do drive by of many houses as we live in the the south of England.  These drive by visits was done over time to get a better understanding of the colour and different styles of flint and brick.

- How did the 2017 reference photo influence your 2025 project?
see above for this answer

- What scale did you decided on and why?
select a scale was largely influenced by the original photo and the remaining of the scale was reduced from it.  The actual base is 20cm * 25 cm and the house is 13cm long and 12 cm high and 10cm.  Scale is approx 1:100 with 1cm approx 1m  looking back the different parts on the board is more about allowing the size of items to visually fit together, rather than exact scaled item.  The figures used in the model is plastic figures and in real terms they may not fit through the doors of the houses, but it not distracting as such.

### Construction Technique Development

Through research and planning, I developed a construction approach using thin wood slats of approx 2mm on paper as a frame. paper was glued on both side and ribs was added to prevent the paper from sagging in the middle. Each wall was measured and formed separate, allowing for the windows and doors. The cottage have 4 sets of outer walls each with different heights and widths. The walls were all painted with white acrylic as a base cover.

tec-cottage-001.jpg 2.5mmm walls made of two sheets of paper with wood slates inbetween.

Paper was painted in a red brick allowing for some variations in colour. the paper was cut with a guiliotene in strips of approx 2.5 mm and then cut in lengths of approx 5 mm. The bricks where then glued onto the white wall in decorative patterns around the doors, windows and edges of the walls. space was left in the middle for the flint stone.

The windows and door frames all had strips of the brown paper glued in.

tec-cottage-002.jpg bricks and flint stone applied on the walls before fitting

modelling past on a small applicator was then used to fill all the white spaces between the bricks and roughened to create the small divets to represent the stones. The modeling past was lightly dry brushed to weather and age the flint stones.

The walls were then glued together using square 5mm wooden corners to neatly put each sub building together.  The windows were all fitted individually with 7 layers: the outer white frame, 1 mm white paper strips, inner white frame and pane frames of .5mm white paper strips, hard plastic for the glass, thick card stock in the inside to allow for the window to be pushed into the cavity, a backing sheet to allow for the window to be wider than the cavity to provide for the window to be glued in place on the inside of the wall

tec-cottage-003.jpg individual structures glued together, with windows fitted before assembling

A flat piece of wood was used for the door, painted dark and a small handle from wire fitted. The door was added into the door frame using coloured paper for the door frame.

tec-cottage-004.jpg door inserted.

with the small front door section assembled, the assembly of the main building could be started.

tec-cottage-017.jpg combing the front door and main residence

Adding the room above the front door presented a clamping challenge.  I had to improve a series of push and hold clamps, and provide some improvised weights from the top to hold it all together while drying

tec-cottage-018.jpg  clamping from all sides.

On completion of the clamping all the facades of the building was in place and measuring up the roof could start.

tec-cottage-019.jpg multi facetted roof requirements become more evident.

Started off by using sheets of paper to model each facade of the roof. The top ridges where made by glueing half of double folder paper, and using the other side as a V shape to fit over the roof. The ridge was then cut wit a zig-zag scissors and painted in red.  The entire roof was then painted in dark brown to serve as the base for the roof tiles.

The chimney was constructed seperately by covering a square 1cm square balsawood with bricks, similar to the walls, adding a cap and then a half piece of bamboo on top. as part of fitting the roof, the chimney was glued in again the inner wall and the roof modelled around it.

tec-cottage-020.jpg roof backing fitted on all the facades

To make the tiles, heavier paper was pre-painted, then cut into strips of approx 4mm and then lenghs of approx 5mm. each row of tiles were then glued from the bottom up.  Soffits was made from wood, painted, and then fitted around the edges of the roof.

tec-cottage-016.jpg tiles glued in and soffits fitted.

This technique provides:

- Structural rigidity from the wood frame
- Better bonding surface for modeling paste
- Reduced risk of cracking or flaking

Following through the cottage build took some time.  Each step was an experiment in itself. Material selected, then prepared and coloured which in itself had to dry, then cut and shaped, then glued in and then fitted together.  All parts and aspects where designed as the build process moved along, rather than as one grandious plan and predesigned parts.  Parts have been fitted, and taken apart on many occasions and every major step was preceded with a test run that was put aside later.

It took about 1 month to complete the cottage.

## Chapter 3: Base and Foundation Construction
**Timeline: August 15 started
**Source Folder:** `Base/` 

With the cottage completed, the positioning and layout of the garden could commence planning.  I decided to position the cottage at an angle to the base. This left more room to explore different faces of the garden in more details without having to include the full surrounding of the cottage.

tec-base-011.jpg illistrate my paper diagram of the layout while visualising it with the actual cottage.

I thought it would add a better perspective of the garden by adding some colour to the plan.

tec-base-012.jpg the path from the gate to the front door and around the house to the backdoor.

then the plan is drawn on the base.  The base itself is made of planks, cut from the bayleave tree in the garden and laminated together.

tec-base-013.jpg fitting the cottage on the base.

The house is fixed to the base by glueing a mounting plate on the base of the cottage hidden from site, and screwing the cottage to the base from beneath. With the cottage screwed on, the landscaping can begin. The surroundings around the cottage were devided into different zones. Starting with the tarmac path and front fence. then the footpath around from the gate to the front door, and around to cottage to the back door. the next zone was the front lawn and side lawn.  Space was left between the path and the cottage, and lawn and the cottage as another zone for plants around the house.  Another zone was the open space beyond the path in the front garden, and opesite the back door into the back garden. This was the wider garden areas.

tec-base-014.jpg illustrating the landscaping in progress.

The first zone to visualise was the road in front of the house. For the tarmac, pieces of welsh slate was crushed and then sifted to seperate the crushed stone into fine, and medium course grains.  Used laminate floor underlay, sealed with Mod Podge glue to serve as the road base. The fine crushed stone was then mixed with Mod Podge and pasted on the road base. courser stone was spread on the surface in some areas.  The road base was then glued on the model base. 

tec-base-015.jpg. finished tarmac, fence and gate.

The next zone where the paths.  Strips of floor underlay was cut for each section of the paths, sealed with Mod Podge.  The course pieces of crushed slate was mixed with some fine sand and Mod Podge to form a paste. This was then spread thinly on the strips using paint to enhance the colouring of the paths. These paths can be seen in the images above. 

With the paths positioned, the underlay could again be put into use for the lawns. cut to size and sealed again, the lawn base were painted amd when dried, a static grass applicator could be applied using slightly different colours of static grass, and also slightly different lengths of of the material to create the lawns.

With the paths glued in the fence could go in. The wood for the fence is mature and dried bamboo, cut with a band saw into about 5 mm strips. A hand plane is then used to square some of the strips for the posts, and other of the strips are futher planed down for the strips.  The posts of the fence is cut out and the tips bevelled.  After determining where the gate will be, holes are drilled in the base and the posts glued in. The rails are then cut to size and fit to the posts on each side of the gate.  The gate was then measured to fit in the gap, and made from the same bamboo source.  Finally, a made a jig to have 5 strands of wire running alongside each other approx 3mm apart and then used super glue to fix the vertigal wires to form a mesh.  This was cut to size and fixed to the fence.  The sement edge between the road and fence was also made from wood, shaped a bit different and painted greying with  tint of green to form the cement edge of the road.

With a large part of the landscaping now prepared, and visualised, I turned my attention to finish the preparation of the plants.  Each plant was individually created, positioned, and matched with the surrounding plants and available space to get a sense of the plants to make, the quantities needed to fill the space and the colour schemes.

tec-plants-001.jpg a selection of the plants in progress.

the main tree was created by twisting copper wire. The main branches where formed from thicker copper wire, further thickened and tapered with hot glue. The thinner branches where individually twisted and then fixed to the main branches using the hot glue gun.  The tree was then spray painted with dark brown and pointed on a jig that will allow me to add the leaves.  Paper, first painted with a light green, was cut with a leaf stencil, ultimately about 3 sheets of A4 paper was used. for about two weeks the leaves were painstakingly glued to the tips of the wire, working from the bottom upwards.

The plants and flowers where then finished off and installed around the house. Each flower is made, using different techniques 

Following is a celebration of the plants around the house.

Reflect on the complete journey:
- Total time invested (estimated hours)  2 months 
- What are you most proud of? The quality of the cottage and plants have improved significantly since the start.  Many newly discovered or refined techniques where used including using the static grass applicator; improved wiring; in many cases the parts were first tested and then built, which gave more confidence; 
- Inotruction of more materials:  modelling paste; micro plastic plants such as grasses and side walk flowers; stencils to cut flowers and leaves; plastic figures, floor underlay in the base; cutting strips from bamboo and forming it for specific use - bamboo is actually a fantastic material to work with 
- making more jigs and support for working with miniatures such as micro cutting board, jig to hold wiring to provide for me free hand use; 
- What was the most challenging aspect? building the cottage in 3D from a 2D picture without plans
  
- What would you do differently? tree leaves are too large; side walk colour and surface not completely right; lighting in the house
- What did you learn from this project?  Patience, persistence, try and retry, increased colour appreciation
  
- How does it compare to previous projects?  This project is defintely an improvement in quality and detail from previous projects.
