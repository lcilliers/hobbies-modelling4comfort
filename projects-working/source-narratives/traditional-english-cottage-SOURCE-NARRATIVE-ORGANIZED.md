# Traditional English Cottage - Organized Narrative

## Project Overview


Add opening paragraphs that introduce:
- The project inspiration and goals
  
This project has in interesting and odd origination.  After completing the caravaning project, thoughts were going around on what next.  I did not want to tackle another commission and continued  to be facinated by scratch building. I eventually decided to trawl through all our photos to see if some inspiration will jump out.  I came accross this photo of a beautiful countryside house and noticed that the photo was taken by my wife when we had a country side drive in the Meon valley, Hampshire, UK in 2017.  The photo was ideal with great features.  

- What made you choose a traditional English cottage
- Your vision for the finished piece
- Brief overview of the journey ahead

## Chapter 1: Architectural Research and Planning
**Timeline: July 2017 - September 2025**  
**Source Folder:** `planning/` (32 photos)

### [COMPLETE] Architectural Style Selection

The house design is based on a traditional English cottage, characterized by distinctive architectural features typical of southern English countryside:

- Steeply pitched gable roof
- Brick and flint walls (characteristic of Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent)
- Decorative brickwork around windows and doors
- Cottage garden with flowers and wooden fencing

The use of flint and brick is particularly common in areas where flint is naturally abundant, creating that authentic southern English appearance.

[NEEDS MORE]
Add details about:
- When and why did you start researching this style?
- What specific aspects of English cottages appealed to you?
- Did you visit any real cottages or use specific reference materials?
- How did the 2017 reference photo influence your 2025 project?
- What scale did you decide on and why?

### [COMPLETE] Construction Technique Development

Through research and planning, I developed a construction approach using thin wood slats on paper as a frame. This technique provides:

- Structural rigidity from the wood frame
- Better bonding surface for modeling paste
- Reduced risk of cracking or flaking

**Surface Preparation:**
- Lightly sand wood slats if glossy
- Apply PVA glue or thin gesso layer to paper for better paste adhesion

**Brick Pattern Method:**
- Use flexible stencil (acetate or vinyl)
- Press gently into wet modeling paste
- Remove stencil carefully to avoid lifting paste

**Flint Detailing:**
- Sharp pin or sculpting tool for irregular flint shapes
- Tiny crushed stones or beads for 3D texture effect

**Finishing Process:**
- Slow, even drying (keep flat, avoid direct sunlight)
- Seal with matte varnish or diluted PVA
- Painting: dry brushing and washes for texture
  - Flint: dark grey base, white/grey highlights
  - Brick: burnt sienna/terracotta base, white mortar lines

[NEEDS MORE]
Add details about:
- Did you test any techniques before starting?
- Were there other construction methods you considered?
- What influenced your choice of this particular technique?
- Did you practice on test pieces first?
