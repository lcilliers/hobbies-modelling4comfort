## THE BEGINNING: FROM GARDEN WASTE TO CREATIVE INSPIRATION

[COMPLETE]

**When:** Started January 20, 2024


**Inspiration:** Cathy's flower house kit introduced me to the skill of making small plants, and I love plants. Cathy's flower house kit had all the plants, flowers and garden related equipment flatpacked, indexed and materials supplied. It had proper guidance on the assembly and preparation.  With this knowledge and inspiration, I wanted to make it myself.  A key interest of mine was to use materials around the house, in my tool room and in the garden. I wanted to select an approach that will allow me to experiment with this new found ideas.  At this stage I had no idea of the terms such as diorama or scratch build.  I only discovered later, when I started to do more research on the internet, what my approach was called, and an entire industry behind it with lots of very skilled and experienced enthusiasts all over the world.  

As a keen gardener I cultivate an active composting area with a aim to recycle the majority of garden material. Some thicker branches (1.5 inch and more) could not go through the chipper. I then started to experiment with slicing the branches into 2 mm * 50 mm strips. This inspired me to use these strips to build a cabin with it.  Internet search had some lovely cabins

All 42 research images have been optimized and are available at:
- Site: assets/images/projects/log-cabin/log-cabin-research-[category]-###.jpg
- Categories: cabin (17), figure (10), landscape (1), plant (4), river (4), struct (6)

**Initial Planning:** I first had to figure out how large it should be, and put some plans together.

site images for log-cabin is at assets\images\projects\log-cabin

Next step was to create a paper and cardboard model of the cabin to get the footprint and decide on the scale.  See assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-002.jpg for the prototype of the cabin. The size of the cabin is 13cm × 9cm.

**My Scale Approach:** I worked "accurate to the eye rather than mathematically precise" - sizing components by what looked right rather than strict scale calculations. I cannot make architectural drawings, so I had to size, measure and fit each component during the building process.

This lead to figure out the landscape around the cabin. Key features that I wanted to be in the landscape is a river, some larger trees and a rocky backdrop.  However, it all had to fit onto a 25cm × 25cm base due to space limitations.

## BASE CONSTRUCTION - THE CRACKING DISASTER

[COMPLETE]

**Materials Used:**
- 20mm Styrofoam (seemed just the right material for the base and rocky backdrop)
- Flour, PVA glue, water, vinegar, cooking oil (actual paste mixture)
- Thin plywood (backing for cliff support)

**What I Did:**

Setting the cabin against the backdrop of a rocky cliff led to pieces of styrofoam being glued together into the bare shape of the cliff. I quickly realised that it would need some support for the cliff and added a thin plywood backing initially.

**Rocky Backdrop Design Decision:** I retained the rocky backdrop even though the scale isn't strictly realistic in relation to the cabin. My reasons:
- Creates perspective and depth in the scene
- Dramatic visual effect of the rocks
- Allows me to show different types of trees growing on rocks
- Provides surfaces for moss and lichen details
- Artistic freedom to create the composition I wanted

Fitting the backing to the height of the rocks in diagonal lines helped to sturdy the structure and allowed the eye to see the continuation of the rocky backdrop.

**The Paste Problem:**
 image assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-001.jpg show the prototype cabin in relation to the rocky backdrop with the cabin almost built into the base of the rocks and to potential location of the river.

 I then had to research on how to make my own paste or clay to cover the styrafoam. Noticed that there are a wide variety of recipies, but the main ingredients was flour, PVA glue and water, with a bit of vinegar and cooking oil.  The vinegar is used to suppress mould and the cooking oil helps with making the mixture less sticky. 

Mixed a paste of flour, PVA glue and water, with a bit of vinegar and cooking oil, then covered the foam with layers and let it dry. (get some recipies from the internet as an example)  It took some time to dry, and I most probably started to early with adding the landscaping structures.  It continued to crack for some time and started to curl (visible on assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-003.jpg). I changed the mixture a few times, experimenting with colouring the mixture, and filling in the cracks.

Landscape base painted and ready for installation. 

**Backing Material Change:** I changed the rocky area backdrop from plywood to proper wood strips glued together. Three reasons for this change:
1. Consistency - using natural wood from the garden matched my overall approach
2. Improved stability - stronger structural support
3. Better aesthetics - natural wood grain and texture

The edges of the lower ground area were all framed to hide away the polystyrene base. All wood material came from garden trees, properly dried and cut into strips of different thicknesses and widths with a table saw.

Reference: \\LSUK-SYNRACK\HomeMedia\hobbies\model building\cabin_in_woods\build photos\20240318_063446.jpg

**BIG PROBLEM:** It cracked badly, most likely because of the composition on the paste mix.

**Solution:** I kept filling in the cracks until it hardened off.

**Timeline:** Spent days filling cracks - probably closer to 2 weeks total

**What I Learned:** Next time I'd add more PVA, less water. I will explore other ingredients in future models (for instance plaster, wood sawdust, paper mache)

---

## PLANT MATERIAL COLLECTION (Parallel Work During Base Drying)

[COMPLETE]

**Timeline Overlap:** While waiting for the paste to dry and dealing with the cracking issues, I continued working by collecting and preparing materials for plants and trees. This kept momentum going during the frustrating drying period.

**Materials Collected:**
- Twigs and dried plant roots
- Sisal (untwining pieces of sisal rope for pine needles)
- Dried moss
- Different types of grass
- Sawdust (for foliage texture)
- Sifted soil
- Small stones (horticultural grit)
- Pillow filling (for shrubs and bushes)

Reference photos:
- assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build3-002.jpg - tubs with different materials gathered and prepared
- assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-006.jpg - grasses and twigs collected

Combined with research on the internet I started to experiment with:
- Colouring the sawdust (to cover the twigs for trees and shrubs)
- Colouring the sisal for making pine trees
- Using glue gun to set the grasses into little bundles
- Attaching twigs to main branches using drill and pin technique and using CA glue to fix the twigs in place to improve shape of trees
- Using pillow filling for shrubs and low bushes, gluing sawdust to the filling for texture

**Custom Tool Creation:** Made a tool for twisting the wires and setting the sisal into the pine trees. [TODO: Take photo of this tool and add to documentation]

[PLACEHOLDER FOR TOOL PHOTO: Custom wire-twisting tool for pine tree construction]

This experimentation led to selecting trees and shrubs that could potentially be used in the landscape. Many attempts were discarded before achieving the right look.

## CABIN CONSTRUCTION

[COMPLETE]

with a good selection of landscape material at hand, I decided to build the cabin.

**Materials:**
- Wood strips reclaimed from garden tree branches
- Wood strips for structural elements
- Dowels for the roof (reference: \\LSUK-SYNRACK\HomeMedia\hobbies\model building\cabin_in_woods\build photos\20240225_072535.jpg)
- Balsa wood for cabin base
- Air dry clay to create stone-textured effect for the chimney (references: assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-009.jpg and \\LSUK-SYNRACK\HomeMedia\hobbies\model building\cabin_in_woods\build photos\20240224_054817.jpg) The bricks was painted in different shades of acrylic reddish wand weathered with some black and white  log-cabin-build2-002.jpg
- Painted chimney shown in assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build2-002.jpg
- 3 sheets of 80gr paper glued together to create right thickness for roof tiles (reference: \\LSUK-SYNRACK\HomeMedia\hobbies\model building\cabin_in_woods\build photos\20240225_072553.jpg)

**Wall Construction Method:** Each wall was separately framed and then fitted with the wood strips to complete the walls. Windows and doors were all framed individually. This approach made assembly easier and allowed me to ensure everything was square before joining walls together. Since I cannot make architectural drawings, I had to size, measure and fit each component during the building process - this was particularly important for positioning the doors and windows correctly, and fitting the chimney.

Reference: assets\images\projects\log-cabin\log-cabin-build1-008.jpg shows framed walls

**Planning Phase:**
- Researched authentic log cabin construction techniques
- Gathered reference images of traditional cabin architecture
- Planned cabin dimensions and layout
- Sketched basic structure
- Built a prototype to visualise the layout, wall and roof measurements, scale and positioning

**Building the Cabin:**

Each log was individually cut to size and fitted. The logs were stained to add color variation and natural wood tones, but I did not do any bark texturing - the natural texture of the wood strips provided the character.

**Wall Construction:**
- Corner notching carefully cut to interlock logs authentically
- Each log cut to length with slight variations for realism
- Stained with various wood tones for natural variation
- Fitted and glued in place with corner notches aligned
- stone wall on foundations to level cabin, horticultural grit used for stones.  Weathered with plants growing in wall.
- 

**Challenges:**
- Maintaining consistent log diameter while adding texture
- Aligning corner notches precisely for tight fit
- Keeping walls level as height increased

**Roof Construction:**
- Ridge beam running length of cabin
- Individual rafters spaced evenly
- Cross bracing for stability
- Roof boards laid perpendicular to rafters
- Individual shingles cut and applied row by row
- Shingles were time-intensive but worth the effort

**Final Structural Elements:**
- brick chimney built with airdry clay with mortar lines scatched in
- Front porch posts with supporting beams log-cabin-build2-001.jpg
- Initial weathering applied to entire structure
- fire wood rack on porch with stacked ready to use wood log-cabin-build5-007.jpg
- wooded chair on porch, weathered log-cabin-build5-007.jpg
- clay flower pot with plant 
- trellis over porch on side with vine growing through log-cabin-build2-001.jpg.  Trellis support is bamboo, with the footing made from a thicker bamboo finish the bootom fitting.
- wooden stairs from the porch down to the river. log-cabin-build5-005.jpg
-  
**Time Investment:** Approximately 40-45 hours total

## PLANT MATERIAL COLLECTION & PREPARATION

[COMPLETE]

**When:** After cabin structure complete, focus shifted to vegetation (around early March 2024)

**Collection Sources:**
- Local woodland areas (small twigs and branches)
- Garden prunings (fine branching structures)
- Dried flowers and seed heads (foliage texture)
- Moss and lichen specimens
- Fine grasses and stems

**Selection Criteria:**
- Appropriate scale when reduced to 1:35
- Structural integrity after drying
- Natural branching patterns
- Texture variety

**Tree Preparation Process:**

Built 8 main tree armatures (heights 5-12cm) and 15 smaller saplings/bushes.

**Tree Assembly Steps:**

making the shrub base from twisted copper wire. log-cabin-build4-005.jpg

glueing the moss on the shrub structure and letting it dry log-cabin-build4-003.jpg
1. Select main trunk with good taper and character
2. Drill small holes at natural branch points
3. Insert and glue secondary branches using CA glue, strengthened by inserting a steel wire pin
4. Add finer twigs to branch tips for detail
5. Paint trunk and branches with bark colors
6. Apply washes to enhance texture and depth
7. Add foliage using scenic adhesive or hairspray
8. Seal entire tree with matte varnish

**Preservation Techniques:**
- Air dried in dark, dry location to prevent color fade
- Treat with clear matt vanish solution for flexibility retention
- After painting and drying, sealed with diluted PVA (white glue)
- Stored in labeled containers by material type

**Foliage Processing:**
- Dried thoroughly to prevent decay
- Broke into appropriately scaled pieces
- Sorted by texture and color
- Treated with diluted PVA to seal and strengthen

**Material Categories:**
- Fine foliage (tree canopies and dense vegetation)
- Ground cover (various textures for forest floor)
- Undergrowth (medium-scale plants and bushes)
- Dead vegetation (brown and grey for forest litter)

**Challenges:**
- Finding branches at appropriate scale required extensive searching
- Some materials proved too fragile after drying
- experimenting with different types of material,quite a bit of experimentation had to be discarded.
- Color changes during drying weren't always predictable
- Organization of many small components

**Time Investment:** Approximately 25-30 hours

## SCENERY BUILDING

[COMPLETE]

**Base Construction:**
- 30cm x 25cm wooden platform
- Foam core layers shaped for elevation changes
- Carved pathways and clearings around cabin
- Strategic placement points marked for trees and vegetation

**Ground Texturing Process (Built in Layers):**

**Layer 1 - Base:**
- Diluted PVA glue brushed over entire surface
- Fine sand and soil mixture sprinkled while wet
- Multiple coats for solid, durable base
- Allowed to dry completely between coats

**Layer 2 - Secondary Texturing:**
- Coarser sand and small gravel in pathway areas
- Fine turf fibers in grassy areas
- Darker earth tones near cabin for trampled look
- Stone texture added with small pebbles

**Layer 3 - Organic Material:**
- material is collected and prepared from various sources and then organized for easy access when needed to match texture and colour.  log-cabin-build3-002.jpg

this include : sifted gravel, grasses; dried moss from the roof; tea-leave, bark, different colouring of hollowfibre, different colours and grades of saw dust, spagnum moss, coloured in different shades, horticultural grid, sisal untwisted from ropes and cut into short pieces and many more. 

** flowing plants

** foot paths **
- foot path from the river to the rear of the house and up the cliff with rich foilage of different forest plants and shrubs. small blue bells lining the path. path is covered with a mixure of tea bags. coloured saw dust in green, and different shades of brown. log-cabin-build5-004.jpg, log-cabin-build4-011.jpg
- The footpath along the river side has a rich set of plants growing on the one side and the river bank on the other. Leading up to the bridge.  log-cabin-build5-003.jpg
- 

**Tree Placement Strategy:**

fir trees on the rocky cliff log-cabin-build5-009.jpg and log-cabin-build4-011

the selection of trees and shrubs is built up, experimenting with different materials.  log-cabin-build1-005.jpg:  dried plant roots turned upside down to form a tree; twiggs selected for the tree like form and glueing moss on it, other twiggs are covered with fine pieces hollowfibre from cushions to form a mat, and then covered with colored saw dust. I found the pyracantha shrub particularly handy with it long thorns and tough wood, resembling a tree frame.  The thorns were covered with thinned and coloure hollowfibre and saw dust.  this picture shows the trees where they potentially can be placed log-cabin-build1-010.jpg.  The two main tall trees to the back of the house. log-cabin-build4-012.jpg.

Installed 8 trees using this method:
1. Drill hole in base slightly smaller than tree root wire
2. Insert tree and test positioning
3. Remove and fill hole with thick PVA glue
4. Reinsert tree and support until glue sets
5. Add scenic glue around base
6. Cover with ground materials to hide join

**Placement Principles:**
- Larger trees positioned in background for depth
- Trees placed in natural-looking groups, not evenly spaced
- Varying heights to create forest canopy levels
- Some trees angled for natural growth patterns
- Dead trees added for realistic forest variety

**Undergrowth Application:**
- Dense vegetation in background and sides
- Lighter vegetation near pathways and cabin
- Bush materials for medium-height plants
- Fine static grass for ground-level growth
- Moss patches on rocks and shaded areas

**Composition Principles Applied:**
- Depth and perspective (larger elements in foreground)
- Natural randomness (avoided symmetrical placement)
- Visual balance (cabin off-center for interest)
- Scale consistency (all vegetation appropriately sized)

**Challenges:**
- Balancing detail density - knowing when to stop adding materials
- Maintaining scale consistency with natural materials
- Working around already-placed trees to add undergrowth
- Preventing glue from showing through ground cover

**Time Investment:** Approximately 45-50 hours

##STRUCTURES AND FIGURES

COMPLETED

FIGURE

I wanted to add a figure next to the river, but make the figure myself. At this point I have never made any figures, so this was completely new territory.  The only clay I had available was Milliput standard two part epoxy putty.

Research was done to visualise an appropriate figure, and then how to make it. A collection of the figures I considered is in log-cabin-research-figure-003.jpg.  Playing with the epoxy I soon realised it is not easy at all and finally decided to make my life a bit easier by selecting the image in the bottom right hand.  log-cabin-build1-004-figure.jpg illustrate my attempt to sculpture my first figure (not picture is small, may need custom display CSS).  log-cabin-build5-001.jpg show how it turned out in the model.

Some of the challenges I faced was getting the proportions right; the epoxy putty was difficult to work with and arms and legs kept breaking off; finer detail such as the face, hands etc. was impossible for me to master. In later models I changed to different clay, wiring of the figure, studies and got guidance on proportions. I was nevertheless proud for my first miniature man catching fish next to the river.

BRIDGE CROSSING

I first cut two strips in a bow for the sides of the bridge, glued some planks on it, I then cut and sanded 1.5 mm square poles and cut them to size. A hole was drilled in each, a copper eyelit bent and fixed to an old yewelry chain and each side.  Aging and weather was done with some acrylic paint.

The bridge in progress is amongst the parts display in log-cabin-build3-003.jpg.  I played around with positioning the bridge over the river, from left to right as shown in log-cabin-build1-010.jpg,  and finally positioned it to allow more space for the fisherman to the edge of the model, but that meant i had to put some type of path from the cabin stairs along the river to the bridge. log-cabin-build3-008.jpg

The final result of the bridge in the model can be seen at log-cabin-build5-002.jpg and log-cabin-build5-006.jpg

LOGGING STATION

No log cabin is complete without a logging area. I had to build the two man crosscut saw with a logging stand. The saw blade was cut from can tin with two handles glued at the end. The stand was glued together from roughcut wood strips with the log pile made up of twiggs from the garden.   It was all finally positioned at the rear of the cabin, surrounded by a tree, grasses, moss and tea leaves to cover the base. log-cabin-build3-004.jpg shows the finished item. log-cabin-build5-008.jpg



[COMPLETE]

**Weathering Applied Throughout Scene:**

**Cabin Weathering:**
- Dirt splash on lower logs from rain runoff
- Moss and lichen growth on north-facing surfaces
- Faded wood tones where sunlight would hit
- Darker staining in protected areas
- Dust and cobwebs in porch corners
- Rusty staining around metal fixtures (if any)

**Environmental Weathering:**
- Tree bark variation with washes and dry brushing
- Moss on base of older trees
- Dead leaves in protected corners and against walls
- Path areas lighter from foot traffic
- Erosion marks in soil near drainage paths
- Natural debris accumulated against obstacles

**Micro-Details Added:**
- Woodpile stacked near cabin door
- Simple rustic furniture on porch (chair, small table)
- Stone pathway leading to door
- Small rocks and pebbles in natural arrangements
- Acorns and pine cones scattered on ground

- Sepia wash: For aged wood effects

**Application:**
- Thin washes applied over entire scene
- Subtle earth tone unification
- Darkening shadows under trees and cabin eaves
- Lightening areas where sunlight would naturally hit
- Dust effects on surfaces
- Atmospheric perspective in distant areas

**Protective Finishing:**

**Matte Varnish Spray Application:**
- Tested on scrap materials first
- Applied in thin layers from 30cm distance
- Allowed to dry between coats (4-6 hours)
- Total of 3 light coats
- Avoided pooling in details
- Maintained matte finish throughout

**Purpose:**

## COMPLETION & DISPLAY

[COMPLETE]

**Completion Date:** April 10, 2024

**Display Setup:**
- Displayed under protective clear acrylic case
- Natural materials sealed to prevent deterioration while maintaining organic appearance
- Dark wood base matches forest floor tones
- Small brass nameplate with project title
- Display from slightly elevated angle for best view
- Lighting from above-front simulates dappled forest light

**Final Thoughts:**

The Log Cabin in the Woods project was a rewarding journey into scratch building and natural material diorama work. The three-month build time allowed for careful development of each phase while the scratch-built approach provided complete creative control.

The combination of handcrafted cabin structure, carefully prepared vegetation, and thoughtful scenery building resulted in a cohesive woodland scene that captures the peaceful isolation of a cabin deep in the forest. Each viewing reveals new details, from the weathered cabin logs to the tiny mushrooms in the forest shade.

This diorama demonstrates that patience, attention to natural details, and thoughtful weathering can transform basic materials into a convincing miniature world.
