# Henrhyd Falls South Wales - SOURCE NARRATIVE - PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Project Metadata

**Project Name:** Henrhyd Falls South Wales  
**Scale:** 1:250  
**Dimensions:** 25cm × 25cm base  
**Start Date:** 23 October 2025  
**Completion Date:** November 2025  
**Total Hours:** [TODO: Estimate total time invested]  It lies somewhere between: next feature challenge, materials I want to put to use, inspirational images, something or somewhere crying out for a celebration. In this case of the Henrhyd falls I was looking forward to model something with water, a natural and realistic scene from places that is well known, a new challenge. What about a waterfall, and there are many of them in Wales. I have been to some of them and Wales has stunning natural environments. A quick search lead to the discovery of Henrhyd falls, not too far from where my son lives.

I asked AI to show me how these falls can be converted to a scratch build, and it came up with this illustration.

*Caption: Top-down layout diagram of the 25×25cm base showing the spatial arrangement of the cliff, waterfall, pool, and surrounding terrain. This scale planning document was critical for validating that the vertical 27m drop could work on the compact base.*

I left the idea to chew a bit on it. Maybe another inspiration comes my way.

## Key Features

- **Vertical Waterfall:** 27m drop represented at 10cm height (1:250 scale)
- **Welsh Rock Formations:** Layered sedimentary cliffs with authentic geology
- **Temperate Rainforest:** Ancient woodland with moss, ferns, sessile oak, ash, and alder
- **Hidden Pathway:** Walkway behind the falls (famous from *The Dark Knight Rises*)
- **Natural River Valley:** Pool at base with exit river cutting through gorge
- **Authentic Scale Representation:** Complex vertical terrain on compact 25×25cm base

## Major Challenges

1. **Vertical Scale Challenge:** Representing a 27m waterfall (10cm model height) plus 12m cliff above (5cm) and 7m valley below (3cm) totaling 18cm vertical terrain on small base
**Why Henrhyd Falls specifically?**
- Waterfall and river combination
- Rich nature scene with lots of different plants
- Interesting rock formations
- Close to where my son lives in Wales

**Personal Connection:**
I love nature, and waterfalls have a wonderful fascination and serenity.

**Technical Challenges to Explore:**
- First waterfall project - scratch building water is a key challenge
- Cliffs and rock formations remains ongoing challenge
- Lots of different color nuances in Welsh geology
## Key Learnings

- **Cooked Paper Pulp Success:** Thoroughly cooking the shredded paper, flour, water, vinegar, PVA, and filler mixture dramatically improved bonding and eliminated cracking
- **Thin Layer Technique:** Building base in 2-3cm layers with thorough drying between applications prevents internal moisture problems
- **Patience in Drying:** Using oven assistance but not rushing - impatience leads to having to restart
- **Scale Planning Critical:** AI helped validate 1:250 scale but actual elevation calculations revealed initial AI side profile was incorrect (missed slope at bottom and elevation above falls)
- **Research Breadth Required:** No single definitive reference image - required amalgamation of multiple sources for authentic representation

## Chapter 1: Concept & Planning
**Timeline:** 23 October 2025

### Initial Inspiration

**Reference Image Gathering:**
Research started this time by asking AI for an illustrative picture. This was largely for assessing if the scale of the waterfalls will fit and work on the designated 25 * 25 cm board. Having confirmed that it is suitable, the research extended into collecting every image of the falls I could find. I did ask my son if they have been there, and if he has any pictures - unfortunately none came to light. I would have loved to visit the site, but the opportunity was not there during the build - I will visit it at some point.

In gathering the images it was necessary to get perspectives of the falls from a distance, as well as close up to see more detail. This was particularly difficult as most pictures focussed on something specific, but few were landscape related. The pictures of the rock formations were very varied in quality and focus, and this lead to a wider search of Welsh rock formations and river scenery. I wanted to have some focussed plants and trees, and had to do wider research of local plants and trees as the general pictures did not give any prominence to the general habitat around the falls.

**Resources Used:**
- Website for the falls
- YouTube for learning about making waterfalls and other waterfall builds
- Tourist and Welsh natural resources and tourist sites
- Social media for others that visited the falls
- Other diorama artists on their sites for general input

Analyse the images in \\lsuk-synrack\HomeMedia\hobbies\model building\Henrhyd-falls\web-optimized\planning\

**Total: 62 reference images**

*Caption: Henrhyd Falls Batman film location in Brecon Beacons. This reference was valuable for understanding the cave formation behind the falls - the feature that made it famous as a filming location for The Dark Knight Rises.*

**Most Helpful Approach:**
The lack of a single definitive picture that provided everything I needed meant this diorama became an artistic representation of a range of different features, plants and scenarios. However the core recognisable imagery for a straight high fall, caves behind the falls, large trees on the top of the cliff,
I have not done a waterfall as yet, scratch building water is a key challenge;  cliffs and rock formations remains a challenge; lots of different colour nuances.

### Research Phase
**Why 1:250 Scale?**
Getting the right scale was important at an early stage as the whole landscape had to fit on a small board. AI was helpful in validating this and came up with the overall selection of the scale.

**Composition Planning:**
The composition was planned using the AI representation and several different photos, and then roughly sketched out on a piece of paper to get the cliff, and enough of the lower ground into the picture to make it representative.

**Base Size:**
The base size was 25 * 25 cm, and that was definitive. The selection of the model had to fit the base size.

**Challenge of Representing a 27m Waterfall:**
The waterfall height did represent a challenge. At the scale this would mean the falls had to be 10cm, there should be some lift in the landscape at the bottom of the falls, lets say about 3cm which really means a 7 meter drop for the pond and run off at the bottom, and the rocky mountain where the river cuts through of about 5cm which represents approx 12m above the cut through and therefore approx 45 meter cliff from bottom to the top of the rocks - about 18cm high model overall.

Although the AI calculations of the side profile for the falls were helpful, it was actually incorrect and did not include the elevation above the falls, and the slope at the bottom of the falls.

### Base Construction Process
**Timeline:** Work started on the base on 2 November 2025

**Base Materials:**
The base was cut out of 4mm plywood sheet at 25 * 25 cm. Using the diagram of the layout as a general guide, the base had two first levels on either side, and an inset in the middle where the river would be formed. The cliff range was situated at 2/3 to the back of the board.

**Foundation Structure - First Attempt:**
I made a mixture of shredded paper, flour, water, vinegar, PVA glue and general purpose filler and used it for the first layer. This was left to dry thoroughly. I noticed a lot of cracking, and then decided to next time use the mixture, but thoroughly cook it to allow the flour to bond and to improve the mulching of the shredded paper. This became a really successful mixture.

**Critical Lesson Learned:**
It was really important to lay down the base in thin layers (2-3 cm at most) and let it dry before adding another layer. I used the oven to aid in the drying and it took some time. One time I got impatient and increased the layers. This lead to drying not taking place right through, and ultimately I had to take it apart and start over again.

### Materials Used in Base Construction

- 4mm plywood sheet (25 * 25 cm)
- Shredded paper
- Flour (cooked for better bonding)
- Water
- Vinegar
- PVA glue
- General purpose filler
- The entire cliff was built up with the flour and schedded paper mix.  This made the model quite heavy, but it is sturdy and and easy to work with to drill for inserting the plants and trees.  No foam was used.  Next time I am likely to use foam or lighter material as the core, covering it with the mix to support the texturing.
- The structure was build at a slight inward angle, partially as a result of shrinkage, and partly to keep it firm.  Next time it may be better to make clean straight cuts, although the textured rocky look and feel is quite nice.
- What materials did you use for the base? The base was cut out of 4 plywood sheet at 25 * 25 cm. Using the diagram of the layout as a general guide, the base had two first levels on either side, and an inset in the middle where the river would be formed.  The cliff range was situated at 2/3 to the back of the board.
- How did you structure the foundation?  I made a mixture of shredded paper, flour, water, viniger, PVA glue and general purpose filler and used in for the first layer. This was left to dry thoroughly. I noticed a lot of cracking, and then decided to next time use the mixture, but thoroughly cook it to allow the flour to bond and to improve the mulching of the shredded paper.  This became a really successfull mixture.
- Any challenges with the base framework? It was really important to lay down the base in thin layers (2-3 cm at most)and let it dry before adding another layer.  I used the oven to aid in the drying and it took some time.  One time I got impatient and increased the layers. This lead to drying not take place right through, and ultimately I had to take it appart and start over again.
- 
- How did you plan for the vertical cliff structure? 
[IMAGE: hfs-planning-030.jpg] as a reference.  It was important to maintain the cave behind the waterfall as it is unique to these falls.  From the images it was evident that the cliff is concave with clear rockfaces almost forming a theatre.

Build Log 2 - The Base

### Materials Used

- Base board type and size 25*25 cm; Type 3 ply wood 10mm
- No foam was used
- the bottom layer on the base is think underlay of laminate flooring, basically compressed fibre.
- The underlay was cut to size and then used to build the next layers, it was ot immediate glued to the plywood base. The underlay was painted with pva glue to seal it and let to dry
- before covering the base, the layout was first planned on paper, adding a bit of colour to the drawing to improve the overall evaluation of the effect  hfs-vbase-004.jpg
- the next layer on top of the underlay was to put 3cm by 20 cm by 15 cm wooden strips down to keep the underlay from bending when drying. the wooded strips was covered in a layer of the surface mix.  The surface mixed was made from shredded paper, pva glue, water, and vinigar as a cold mix.  this mix was throughly kneed until a thick past and added to the based leaving thicker at the sides, with a strip for the forming the river rundown in the middle and setting the mount for the rockface to the back. in a 2:3 ratio.  hfs-base-001.jpg hfs-base-002.jpg
-the slow process of building up the layers then started.  The mixture was changed by adding flour to it, and then cooking it to allow the flour and paper schedding to find properly and to become a much finer texture.  The mixture was allowed to cool down, then devided in fist size blobs wrapped in cling film to keep it moist.  Using the blobs the base was then built up leaving enough time for it to dry between every application of approx 2 cm.  hfs-base-003.jpg. Putting the model in the oven at 100c help to speed up the drying, but it still took a long several hours each time.

### Early Challenges

- The rough surface and mallability of the pure shredded paper mix turned out too present potential issued to refine the rocky surface textures, hence changing the mix to a finer paste by adding flour and cooking the mixture.
- The scale of 25cm square, but the requirement of a 27m (10 cm) fall, pushed the boundaries for creating the height of the cliff.  This lead for me to become inpatient, and adding layers before the previous layers were properly dry in in the centre.  
- I basically took the rockface appart and started over again, in thinner layers, and adding more time for drying
- Cracks did appear, but not nearly as large and frequent as in previous models.  Adding the paper mache into the mixed helped a lot to prevent cracking.
