# Traditional English Cottage - Raw Narrative

## [COMPLETE] Architectural Inspiration and Planning

The house in the reference image is a traditional English cottage, characterized by:

- Steeply pitched gable roof
- Brick and flint walls
- Decorative brickwork around windows and doors
- Cottage garden with flowers and wooden fencing

This style is typical of southern English countryside architecture, especially in counties like Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent. The use of flint and brick is particularly common in areas where flint is naturally abundant.

## [COMPLETE] Construction Technique Planning

[AI-CHECK] The following section appears to describe the planned construction approach:

I decided to use a well-thought-out approach with thin wood slats on paper as a frame. This gives the structure rigidity while allowing the paper surface to bond better with the modeling paste. This approach should significantly reduce the risk of cracking or flaking.

### Surface Preparation and Technique

**Surface Prep:**
- Lightly sand the wood slats if they're glossy
- Use PVA glue or a thin layer of gesso on the paper to help the paste grip better

**Stencil Use:**
- For the brick pattern, use a flexible stencil (acetate or vinyl) and press gently into the paste while it's still wet
- Remove the stencil carefully to avoid lifting the paste

**Flint Detailing:**
- Use a sharp pin or sculpting tool to scratch irregular flint shapes between the bricks
- Can also press in tiny crushed stones or beads for a 3D effect

**Drying:**
- Let it dry slowly and evenly to avoid warping—keep it flat and out of direct sunlight
- Once dry, seal with matte varnish or diluted PVA

**Painting:**
- Use dry brushing and washes to bring out the texture
- For flint: dark grey base, then white/grey highlights
- For bricks: burnt sienna or terracotta base, with white mortar lines
