Whether you're just starting out or looking to upgrade your toolkit, here are five essential tools that every model builder should have in their arsenal.

## 1. Quality Hobby Knife

A sharp hobby knife (like an X-Acto #1 or equivalent) is absolutely essential. You'll use it for:

- Removing parts from sprues
- Cleaning up mold lines
- Scribing panel lines
- Detail work

**Tip:** Always use fresh blades. A dull blade requires more pressure and can slip, leading to accidents or damage to your model.

## 2. Precision Tweezers

A good set of tweezers is invaluable for handling small parts. Look for:

- Fine pointed tips for small parts
- Self-closing tweezers for holding parts while glue dries
- Anti-static tweezers if working with electronics

## 3. Sprue Cutters

Proper sprue cutters (also called nippers) make a huge difference compared to twisting parts off the sprue:

- Single-flush cutters provide cleaner cuts
- Leave a small amount of sprue and clean up with knife
- Don't cut too close to the part

## 4. Sanding Sticks and Files

For cleanup and surface preparation:

- Sanding sticks in various grits (400-2000)
- Small needle files for tight spaces
- Sanding sponges for curved surfaces

Start with coarser grits and work your way up for smooth finishes.

## 5. Good Lighting and Magnification

You can't do quality work if you can't see clearly:

- Desk lamp with adjustable arm
- Daylight-balanced bulbs show true colors
- Magnifying glass or head-mounted magnifier for detail work

## Honorable Mentions

- Cutting mat to protect your work surface
- Plastic cement and CA glue
- Putty for filling gaps
- Masking tape

## Building Your Kit

You don't need to buy everything at once. Start with the basics (knife, tweezers, cutters) and expand your toolkit as you take on more complex projects.
