## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION

Coming out of my experience with the Log Cabin and Cathy's Flower House, I really wanted to practice more to make realistic miniature flowers.  The first attempts in the Log Cabin was bit of an eye opener that it would take much more practice, improved techniques and better materials. As a keen gardener, with my own beautiful garden and a huge admiration for English Country gardens, I could not select a better topic to experiment with flower making than to scratch build my own miniature garden.  

This project must capture the romantic beauty and horticultural richness of a traditional English cottage garden. The centerpiece is a historic Victorian cottage with an authentic thatched roof (approximately 11cm high), surrounded by a meticulously detailed 15m × 15m garden (at 1:50 scale).  The thatched roof was specifically included to practice and experiment something different that the slate/tiled roof of the Log Cabin.

The main focus of this build was researching and mastering techniques for creating realistic miniature flowers and plants of all kinds. The garden features over 100 different flowering plant and shrubs and a good selection of trees, each crafted to capture the unique characteristics of English cottage garden favorites.

---

## CHAPTER 1: PLANNING AND RESEARCH
**Timeline:** April 2024 

Selecting the scale, as in the case of the Log Cabin, was determined 
Extensive research and collection of reference material kick started the build. Hundreds of pictures of both formal and cottage gardens, individual plant and flower displays as well as a wide range of thatched roof cottages, especially those with country style gardens were reviewed.  

A few cottages stood out, providing the right layout and look and feel for the targeted base.
