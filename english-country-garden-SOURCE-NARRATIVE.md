## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION

Coming out of my experience with the Log Cabin and Cathy's Flower House, I really wanted to practice more to make realistic miniature flowers.  The first attempts in the Log Cabin was bit of an eye opener that it would take much more practice, improved techniques and better materials. As a keen gardener, with my own beautiful garden and a huge admiration for English Country gardens, I could not select a better topic to experiment with flower making than to scratch build my own miniature garden.  

This project must capture the romantic beauty and horticultural richness of a traditional English cottage garden. The centerpiece is a historic Victorian cottage with an authentic thatched roof (approximately 11cm high), surrounded by a meticulously detailed 15m × 15m garden (at 1:50 scale).  The thatched roof was specifically included to practice and experiment something different that the slate/tiled roof of the Log Cabin.

The main focus of this build was researching and mastering techniques for creating realistic miniature flowers and plants of all kinds. The garden features over 100 different flowering plant and shrubs and a good selection of trees, each crafted to capture the unique characteristics of English cottage garden favorites.

## CHAPTER 1: PLANNING AND RESEARCH
**Timeline:** April 2024 

### scale and layout

Selecting the scale, as in the case of the Log Cabin, was determined by the space available to display. This was long before this site came into being. The overall scale had to be around 25cm square.  With that in mind I tried to imagine the size of the house and garden and put the following prototype together. assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\base\ecg-base-002.jpg

A footprint prototype of the house provided a better assessment of the space on the base

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\base\ecg-base-003.jpg

Extensive research and collection of reference material kick started. Hundreds of pictures of both formal and cottage gardens, individual plant and flower displays as well as a wide range of thatched roof cottages, especially those with country style gardens were reviewed.  

### cottages

A few cottages stood out, providing the right layout and look and feel for the targeted base.

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\cottages\ecg-plan-cot-010.jpg the annex and aging of this cottage appealed to me
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\cottages\ecg-plan-cot-014.jpg the house with annex, tree, path in the middle formed a an appealing combination

### flowers and plants

A large part of the driving force behind the model was making the flowers. I prepared a long list from my own garden book of all the flowers that potentially could be modelled.  I then started to document more detail about each flower, focussing on characteristics such as the flower spike or arrangement, flower base, leaf type and form, flower shape, colour varieties. Some of the plants included in this analysis included foxgloves, delphiniums, roses, hollyhocks, lavender, ferns, hostas, daisies, carea (grasses), poppies, cosmos, clematis,lilies and many more.  ![collage for display while I am building the flowers](assets/images/projects/english-country-garden/planning/flowers/ecg-plan-flw-004.jpg)

These gardens were such an inspiration:

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\flowers\ecg-plan-flw-005.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\flowers\ecg-plan-flw-007.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\flowers\ecg-plan-flw-009.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\flowers\ecg-plan-flw-010.jpg

The gardens from the research was so overwhelmingly beautiful, I almost got distracted and lost in the collection of examples of all the flowers and plants.

Ii my attention had to move on to learn more on how to create these magnificent specimens, especially after my first attempt during the log cabin project demonstrated that it is not that easy. 

Trawling through the internet, botanical books and magazines, and through my own garden book in gardens4comfort.uk I collate may paper cut stencils, paint and drawing stencils and catelogs of flower shapes and types. Some pictures stood out assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\training-and-references\ecg-plan-ref-011.jpg; assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\training-and-references\ecg-plan-ref-015.jpg; assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\training-and-references\ecg-plan-ref-016.jpg;

This inspiration got me straight into experimentation with making flowers.  Research continued to be woven into the practical construction and building. Step 1 was to get a sense for the size and scale of objects, then to imagine the broad layout to determine what type of structures would be required. Work started on making the flowers.  If I could not manage to get the flowers done, there was no use continuing with the other main parts such as the cabin. From previous experience, fitting items to the base follows making most the parts, rather than fitting each part as it is being made.  

## CHAPTER 2:  FLOWERS

Each flower was individually made, and for this materials had to be collated and made.

### material preparation

Wire: I recovered quit a bit of copper wire from wire stripping, capacitor leads and coil windings.  The grades of copper vary from Ultra-fine wire: Almost hair-thin, typically around 0.1 mm or less in diameter, fine wire: Around 0.3–0.5 mm diameter, good for delicate work like flower stems or small details, medium wire: About 0.8–1.2 mm diameter, often used for structural parts or thicker stems and heavy wire: Up to 2 mm diameter, suitable for strong frameworks or bases. I discovered how handy copper wire is in this project, and it is now indespensible in my dioramas.

To prepare, the wire is pre coated with acrylic paint or left water based paint in various darker colours to hide the copper gloss of the wires.  These are then cut into different sizes and bundled together, ready for use.  \assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-035.jpg

Paper: I collected a range of different types of paper for different parts of the flowers including Standard 80 gsm printer paper (for petals and templates), packing tissue (17–35 gsm) (for soft, delicate layers) and Cardstock (160–220 gsm) (for stems, leaves, and structural parts).  Sheets of the different types of paper were colored with acrylic of a range of colours to suite the different flowers.  the sheets were all dried and then filed in a folder for easy access.

Natural materials: saw dust was sifted into different grades, and then coloured in greens, whites, pinks and reds in small quantities.  This was very useful for some of the fine cluster types of flowers.    Other materials used for leaves include, seed heads, spagnum moss, dried twiggs with leaves and tea leaves.

### making flowers

Selecting the methods for making flowers were largely centered around shapes, illustrated well with the following
\assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\training-and-references\ecg-plan-ref-014.jpg

strap shaped (daisy)
bell or funnel shaped (bluebell, arum lily)
Cluster (lavender)
spike (foxgloves, hollyhocks)
Flat top (ammi majus)
distinct petals (rose, dahlia,geum,flox,lily )
star (clematis, marygold)
saucer (butter cup, cosmos)
pompom (poppy, thissle)
trailing (rose, clematis, wisteria)

The following pictures illustrate different techiniques. Note that some of these example experimentations never made it to the garden as I discovered new tools and techniques for making similar flowers.

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-008.jpg making spikes, cluster flowers, and stamin (centre of flowers)

A leather hole cutting tool was used to cut the micro cups, made into a cup with a small size ball scalping tool, it was glued individually to a green wire stem.

The funnel of the arum lilies were made out of clay, and folded around a wire stem dipped in yellow saw dust for the stigma.  The clematis on the arch was also cut out of clay using a home made punch from tin with 4 lobes.

dried twiggs, leaves and sead heads were strenghtened and preserved with dipping them in watery clear varnish, and then painted to enhance the colours

Diamond painting dots became some brightly coloured spiky plants.

plant leaves and flowers where cut out of paper, using modified stencils to compensate for the scale or paper punches. the flower petals were stacked for flowers such as roses

Daisies where cut from 1.5 cm strips of colour paper, then cut into very fine slices in the long end, and then rolled onto to a wire tipped in yellow sawdust to form the center.


Some of the completed fowers can be seen in these displays

### making leafy plants

making the leafs, especially when distinct, for both leafy plants and the base for the flowering plants all centered leaf size and shape.  Ferns were by far the most challenging, especially as at the miniaturisation I am working towards. \assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\training-and-references\ecg-plan-ref-014.jpg.  

Some of the experimentation of the different types of shrubs are in assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-037.jpg

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-056.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-057.jpg

Plants with large leaves where all cut from different green paper sheets, individually glued to a fine wire stem, and then bundled either by twisting the wire stems together, or setting the wire stem in hot glue to create a wider base.  Hostas and ferns in particular was formed in this way. Some examples are

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-055.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-056.jpg

Trailing plants were also added. The stems were left over from a previous model, and the flowers where then added to complete the image.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-053.jpg

### Trees

A variety of different trees were made using the following techniques:

- wire frames branches, buidling out the thicker branches with clay and then painting it.  The branches is covered in a layer of pillow filling and then covered in coloured sawdust of different grades.  I even made some apples with small clay balls, painted and added to the apple tree.  wiring my first tree after checking out some youtube videos assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-014.jpg

using a combination of twiggs and wire, tried to imitate the picture of a tree assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-010.jpg

Tall tree branches was largely twiggs from the garden. This was the first time I added some additional branches by drilling a small hole in the main stem, and in the additional branch, then glueing a this hard wire into the core and finally attaching it to the main stem.  The leaves for the tall tree where all cut with a stamp using paper, individually wired,and then tied and glued into the side branches in bundles.

### structures

The arch in this picture was really attractive and this lead to my first creating the arch,then making the clematis flowers from clay, and finally fitting it all together.

gate and stone wall
wooden gates and low stone walls were often used in historic english gardens. I first made the gate to conceptualise the height of the wall, and then put the wall together using small stones from horticultural grit.

path
The path was made of real slate, crushed into small peaces and then glued in. Filler was used to will the gaps and create the edge.  The steps where squared up and levelled off with filler, then weathered to create cement steps immitation.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\Gallery\ecg-gal-006.jpg


With the majority of the plants and structures created, it was time to get more on the the house.  assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\scenary\ecg-sce-032.jpg shows the selection of plants ready for installation.


## CHAPTER 2: BASE CONSTRUCTION

### Foundation and Terrain

The journey for the base started with sizing the 30cm sqaure plywood with some pictures of a house and base garden layout. 
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\base\ecg-base-001.jpg
as I made progress with the flowers, they were added to the base to maintain the perspective.  Right from the very start, I visualised that the Cottage would be to the back, with a garden path running through the middle from the street to the front door.
This look and feel had a material impact on my choices.  assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\cottages\ecg-plan-cot-002.jpg

assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\base\ecg-base-002.jpg
With a fair amount of plants created, I turned my attention to making a house from paper to plan the footprint of the house in August 2024. which is some months into the project, but I first wanted to confirm my ability to put the plants together before venturing into planning the final layout. By now, I covered the base with home made clay.  This was a mixture of flour, water, white glue, and vinigar.  This time I got the mixture better as it did not crack as badly. 
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\base\ecg-base-003.jpg

With the cottage completed, I started to realise that I need to put an elevation into place to show off the garden better.  Would be great if there could be a garden wall in front of the house with steps going down through the arch to the rest of the garden.  It was then that I added another layer of clay to the back of the base to lift the cottage a bit.

### Preparing for Planting Areas

- the planting areas was carefully planned into areas or rooms. The main feature is the walkway straight from the gate to the front door. the steps and arch allows for a upper level and lower level with access to both sides of the garden from the path onto a lawn and gravel paths around the garden. taller plants is positioned against the container wall through the middle of the garden with smaller plants in front. To the right, at the edge of the garden is a bird bath and small trees. against the cottage walls the ferns and hostas comes to its right with climbing roses and clematis climbing up the wall.  The larger trees frame the rear of the cottage and edges of the garden.

All the plants were prepared as loose units to allow for the selection of colour, size and effect to fill up the different planting zones or grouping of plants. Plants where mostly glued in with a glue gun, while all the trees and shrubs have a pin in the base to firmly fix it into the surface.

The the bight blue clematis on the arch draws the eye in to the center just to fan out into the various pathways around the garden.


## CHAPTER 3: COTTAGE CONSTRUCTION
**Timeline:** The cottage construction started early with the creation of a paper model to size the footprint and location.  With the plants all available for installation, attention moved to the construction of the cottage.

### Building the Structure


- The walls were all cut out of balsawood and covered with a layer of filler, to prepare to wall texture. The walls were all largely completed and textured before assembly.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-003.jpg

- the walls were all pinned together to ensure to confirm measurements and alignment.  Windows and doors marked up on the panels to verify positioning.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-004.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-006.jpg

The Chimney construction was incorporated into the wall constructure. The wall texture was modified to have a brick effect and the chimney itself made from balsawood, covered in filler to allow for the brick effect of the chimney.  The chimney was then glued to the inside of the wall and incorporated into the roof structure. The chimney construction followed this design from the images collected in the planning. assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\planning\cottages\ecg-plan-cot-003.jpg

After confirming that walls design, the windows and doors where cut out and the wall texture applied and painted.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-008.jpg

### The Thatched Roof

next was the construction of the thatched roof. Several youtube videos where very informative. I borrowed some ideas from them, but ultimately chose to use real grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPA61burEnY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK4g8IgfkBQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXXjanD1_JE

Grass from the garden was collected, sorted and cut in small bundles.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-007.jpg
The base of the roof was prepared with strips of wood and then grass bundles glued in starting from the bottom.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-010.jpg
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-011.jpg

One of the key challenges encountered was sorting and bundling to grass.  After struggling for some time, I enginered a V shaped caddy to feed the grass on the one side , sort out the bits not required and then pick a bundel, with all the grass pointing in the same direction.


### Cottage Details and Finishing

With all the components of the cottage ready, assembly could start use wood glue
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-012.jpg

Windows and door frames were added by cutting thin strips of wood color and white paper to frame them. The white paper strips were glued inside thin plastic the resembly the window panes and sash windows.
assets\images\projects\english-country-garden\cottage\ecg-cot-013.jpg

With the cottage finished the installation of the landscape could commence.

## PROJECT STATISTICS AND REFLECTIONS

### Time Investment

this was a lengthy project.In real terms work was done on many different sub sections simultanously to get the balance between making stuff for the first time, versus how many items would be needed, versus layout and size.  This project included many first time activitities and therefore preparation, trying different options, research, sourcing of specialist materials all woven into a lengthly project.

**Build dates:** [COMPLETE]
- Start: April 13, 2024
- Completion: November 30, 2024
- Total duration: 7.5 months (231 days)

### Materials Summary

- Any recycled or repurposed materials?
- Specialty materials that were essential

### Technical Specifications


### Challenges and Solutions

[TODO - User to provide:]
What were your biggest challenges and how did you overcome them?

**Possible challenges to address:**
- Scale consistency across 50+ plant species.  Scale was a mixture of the art of the possible in making something, versus does it look right, versus comparing it with other items
- Achieving realistic flower appearance.  Many forms where experimented with, and although the model flowers were representative, the miniaturisation did result is some flowers that did not come out perfect.  I would call that artistic freedom.
- Thatched roof construction.  Getting the grass smooth and cut exactly as a life size roof would be was a challenge.  Making the tool did help.
- Creating convincing cottage garden aesthetic.  The cottage garden look and feel only came together by trial an error of layout and positioing.  Some flowers were only created right then end to solidfy the final effect.
- Time management over 7.5 months.  Time management was about, dont rush, review regularly, redo if needed. pause and restart.
- Material sourcing. Most materials where sourced from the garden, tool room or around the house. apart from glue and paint, material cost was minimal, but material selection, collection and preparation was much more invovled.
- Technique mastery. Technique was built through research, trial and error, lots of patience and determination.

### Learning and Skills Developed

Update this list from the descriptions in detail.
[COMPLETE - From validated project file, but needs expansion:]
- Miniature flower creation (multiple techniques)
- Foliage and leaf work
- Plant stenciling
- Color mixing for natural plant colors
- Thatched roofing techniques
- Cottage construction
- Terrain building
- Scenic layering
- Weathering and aging


### Personal Reflections

Given that this model brought together my love for plants and gardens, and my newly discovered focus on scratch build an minaturisation, it came out as a success that I can be proud of. It definitely laid the foundation for building more and different models.  The enjoyment and satisfaction of doing it was really remarkable.  I will select more models, to explore more and different materials and skills, build out specialist tools and discover new methods.
