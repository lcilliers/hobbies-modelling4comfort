# Projects Gallery

Welcome to my collection of modeling projects, including dioramas, scratch builds, kits and more. Each piece represents hours of careful craftsmanship, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving. I love to recycle and discover the use of new materials. From maritime vessels to gardens, english houses and tranquil forest scenes, these miniature worlds tell their own stories.

## About My Process

Each project typically involves:

1. **Research & Planning** - Historical accuracy and reference gathering
2. **Base Construction** - Creating the foundation and terrain
3. **Structure Building** - Main elements and architectural features
4. **Detailing** - Fine details, weathering, and character elements
5. **Finishing** - Painting, lighting, and final touches
6. **Photography** - Capturing the finished scene

## Techniques Used

- **Weathering** - Creating realistic age and wear
- **Scratch Building** - Custom elements from raw materials
- **Kit Bashing** - Combining and modifying commercial kits
- **Terrain Making** - Realistic ground, water, and vegetation
- **Lighting** - LED integration for dramatic effect
- **Green Screen Photography** - Composite backgrounds for enhanced presentation
