    <p>Explore My Miniature Worlds</p>
  </div>
</div>

Welcome to my collection of modelling projects - dioramas, scratch builds, kits and more. Each piece represents hours of learning, problem-solving, and figuring things out as I go. I love to recycle and discover new uses for materials. From maritime vessels to gardens, English houses and nature scenes, these miniature worlds tell their own stories.

## How to Explore Projects

Each project page gives an **overview** of the concept, what I was trying to do, and how it turned out. For those who want to dive deeper into the build process, check out the [Build Logs]({{ '/builds/' | relative_url }}) section where you'll find **step-by-step documentation** of construction methods, what worked (and what didn't), and techniques I tried. The [Techniques]({{ '/techniques/' | relative_url }}) section is in early stages of development, but will eventually feature standalone guides and tips pulled from various projects.

    <h3><a href="{{ '/projects/german-sail-boat/' | relative_url }}">Gorch Fock Training Ship</a></h3>
    <p>I never imagined getting involved in model building until I bought a kit for my grandson to inspire him. Years later, after it remained in the cupboard, I offered to build it for him. After several months of intense learning through trial and error, I completed the Gorch Fock training ship in May 2020.</p>
    <p>This detailed replica of a traditional German sailing vessel is complete with authentic rigging and weathered details. Unfortunately I do not have any record of the building process.</p>

    <p>The revolutionary passenger steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Launched in 1843, she was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic.</p>
    <p>This project came about when we visited the SS Great Britain museum in Bristol in December 2021. "This is my next project", I said. My search for a kit to build this ship turned to nothing. Finally, I bought a book about the ship, collated all the materials I could find and embarked on my first scratch build undertaking. This ambitious project captured one of the most significant vessels in maritime history and cemented my fascination with building models from scratch.</p>

## About My Process

Each project typically involves:

1. **Research & Planning** - Historical accuracy and reference gathering
2. **Base Construction** - Creating the foundation and terrain
3. **Structure Building** - Main elements and architectural features
4. **Detailing** - Fine details, weathering, and character elements
5. **Finishing** - Painting, lighting, and final touches
6. **Photography** - Capturing the finished scene

## Techniques Used

- **Weathering** - Creating realistic age and wear
- **Scratch Building** - Custom elements from raw materials
- **Kit Bashing** - Combining and modifying commercial kits
- **Terrain Making** - Realistic ground, water, and vegetation
- **Lighting** - LED integration for dramatic effect
- **Green Screen Photography** - Composite backgrounds for enhanced presentation
