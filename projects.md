Welcome to my collection of modeling projects, including dioramas, scratch builds, kits and more. Each piece represents hours of careful craftsmanship, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving. I love to recycle and discover the use of new materials. From maritime vessels to gardens, english houses and tranquil nature scenes, these miniature worlds tell their own stories.

## Projects (in build sequence)

### [Gorch Fock training ship - 2019]({{ '/projects/german-sail-boat/' | relative_url }})

I have never imagined me getting involved in model building. The closest I got was buying a kit for my grandson to inspire him. Unfortunately it remained in the cupboard, until several years later I offered to build it for him. After several months of intense learning through trial and error I completed the Gorch Fock training ship in 2019.

This detailed replica of a traditional German sailing vessel is complete with authentic rigging and weathered details.  Unfortunately I do not have any record of the building process.

**Status:** Completed  
**Scale:** 1:150  
**Category:** Maritime/Nautical  
**Build Type:** Balsawood kit

### [SS Great Britain - 2022]({{ '/projects/ss-great-britain/' | relative_url }})

The revolutionary passenger steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Launched in 1843, she was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic. 
This project came about when we visited the SS Great Britain museum in Bristol in December 2021. "This is my next project",  I said.  My search for a kit to build this ship turned to nothing. Finally, I bought a book about the ship, collated all the materials I could find and embarked on my first scratch build undertaking.

This ambitious project captured one of the most significant vessels in maritime history and cemented my fascination with building models from scratch.

**Status:** Completed  
**Scale:** 1:96  
**Category:** Maritime/Historical  
**Build Type:** Advanced scratch-build

## About My Process

Each project typically involves:

1. **Research & Planning** - Historical accuracy and reference gathering
2. **Base Construction** - Creating the foundation and terrain
3. **Structure Building** - Main elements and architectural features
4. **Detailing** - Fine details, weathering, and character elements
5. **Finishing** - Painting, lighting, and final touches
6. **Photography** - Capturing the finished scene

## Techniques Used

- **Weathering** - Creating realistic age and wear
- **Scratch Building** - Custom elements from raw materials
- **Kit Bashing** - Combining and modifying commercial kits
- **Terrain Making** - Realistic ground, water, and vegetation
- **Lighting** - LED integration for dramatic effect
- **Green Screen Photography** - Composite backgrounds for enhanced presentation
