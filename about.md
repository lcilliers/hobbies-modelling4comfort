# About Models4Comfort

Welcome to my diorama modeling journey! This site documents my passion for creating miniature worlds - from historical ships to rural scenes, from ancient forests to cozy cabins.

## The Story Behind Models4Comfort

Modeling has always been more than just a hobby for me. It's a form of meditation, a creative outlet, and a way to capture moments frozen in time. Each diorama tells a story, preserves a memory, or brings to life a scene that exists only in imagination.

The name "Models4Comfort" reflects what these projects mean to me - they're comfortable, relaxing, and therapeutic. In a busy world, sitting down to work on a model brings peace and focus. The gentle rhythm of painting, weathering, and building creates a space where time slows down and creativity flows.

### Why Dioramas?

Dioramas combine so many different skills and interests:

- **Historical research** - Learning about ships, buildings, and eras
- **Artistic expression** - Painting, weathering, and composition
- **Technical skills** - Construction, scratch-building, and problem-solving
- **Storytelling** - Creating scenes that evoke emotion and narrative
- **Photography** - Capturing the final result in compelling ways

Each project is an opportunity to learn something new, try a different technique, or push creative boundaries.

## My Modeling Background

### How It Started

Like many modelers, I started young with simple kits - aircraft, cars, and ships assembled with varying degrees of success (and plenty of glue fingerprints). After a long break, I rediscovered modeling as an adult and found myself drawn to more ambitious projects: dioramas that tell complete stories rather than standalone models.

### Current Focus

My primary interests now include:

**Maritime Models** - Historical sailing vessels with full rigging and realistic weathering  
**Rural & Natural Scenes** - Countryside cottages, farms, and woodland settings  
**Architectural Dioramas** - Buildings with character, history, and detail  
**Atmospheric Photography** - Using green screens and digital backgrounds to enhance presentation

### Skills & Techniques

Over time, I've developed capabilities in:

- Scratch-building and kit-bashing
- Advanced weathering and aging effects
- Natural scenery (trees, water, vegetation)
- Ship rigging and nautical details
- Winter and seasonal effects
- Digital photo enhancement with green screen replacement

The [Techniques]({{ '/techniques/' | relative_url }}) section documents these methods for others to learn from and adapt.

## Why Share Online?

### Documentation & Memory

Projects take months or even years to complete. By documenting them online, I create a permanent record of the process - photos of stages that would otherwise be lost, notes about techniques that worked (or didn't), and a timeline of how skills evolve.

### Community & Learning

The modeling community is incredibly generous with knowledge. This site is my way of giving back - sharing what I've learned so others can benefit, avoid my mistakes, and perhaps feel inspired to try something new.

### Accountability & Motivation

Public documentation creates gentle accountability. When progress is visible, it motivates continued work. Build logs turn large projects into manageable milestones.

## The Technical Side

### Website Technology

This site is built with:

- **Jekyll** - Static site generator for fast, secure pages
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting with version control
- **Markdown** - Simple, clean content writing
- **Custom CSS/JavaScript** - Responsive design and image galleries
- **ImageMagick** - Photo optimization and green screen processing

Everything is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/lcilliers/hobbies-modelling4comfort), and the [Publishing Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/PUBLISHING-GUIDE.html) documents the workflow for anyone interested in a similar setup.

### Photography Setup

Project photography uses:

- **Green screen backgrounds** - For clean, replaceable backdrops
- **Digital backgrounds** - Sky scenes with clouds and atmosphere
- **Natural lighting** - Supplemented with diffused LED panels
- **Macro lens** - For detail shots and close-ups
- **Image optimization** - Batch processing for web display

The [backgrounds folder](https://github.com/lcilliers/hobbies-modelling4comfort/tree/main/backgrounds) includes resources and guides for setting up similar photography.

## Why "Models4Comfort"?

The name keeps coming back to the core reason for this hobby: **comfort**. In the act of creating something with your hands, there's a profound comfort. In seeing a blank base transform into a living scene, there's satisfaction. In sharing the journey with others who understand the passion, there's community.

These models aren't just objects - they're tangible evidence of time spent in a state of flow, of challenges overcome, of skills developed, and of stories told. They're comfortable to create, comforting to look at, and hopefully inspiring to others.

## Thank You

Thank you for visiting and taking an interest in these projects. Whether you're a fellow modeler, someone curious about the hobby, or just browsing, I hope you find something here that inspires, informs, or simply entertains.

Now, back to the workbench - those projects won't build themselves!
