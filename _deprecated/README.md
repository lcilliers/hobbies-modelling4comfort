# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains documentation files that have been superseded by current guides.

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE THESE FILES FOR CURRENT WORK

The files in this folder are outdated or have been consolidated into other documentation.

## Why Deprecated?

These files contained information that was either:
- Duplicated in other, more focused guides
- Relevant only during initial setup
- Superseded by improved documentation structure

## For Current Documentation

Refer to these active guides in the root folder:

- **README.md** - Quick start guide  
- **SITE-EDITING-GUIDE.md** - Complete content editing reference
- **PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md** - Git workflow
- **IMAGEMAGICK-GUIDE.md** - Image processing

- **_builds/README.md** - Build log creation
- **scripts/README.md** - Script usage

## Files in This Folder

### PROJECT-README.md
**Deprecated:** December 10, 2025  
**Reason:** Content consolidated into SITE-EDITING-GUIDE.md and other specialized guides  
**Contained:** Initial project setup, static site generator options, deployment instructions

Most content was duplicated across multiple guides. Specialized information moved to appropriate guides.
