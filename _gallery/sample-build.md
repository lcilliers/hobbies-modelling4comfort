### Techniques

This build showcases several common techniques:

1. **Pre-shading**: Dark colors applied to panel lines before base coat

3. **Oil wash**: For adding depth to panel lines and details
4. **Dry brushing**: Highlighting raised surfaces
5. **Pigments**: Adding dust and dirt effects

### Challenges

Every build presents unique challenges. This one required careful masking for the camouflage pattern and patience with the small decals.

### Lessons Learned
