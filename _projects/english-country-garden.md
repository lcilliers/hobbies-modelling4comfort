## Project Overview

An English cottage garden diorama featuring a historic cottage with thatched roof, surrounded by a densely planted traditional cottage garden showcasing the art of miniature flower and plant creation.

## Project Details

**Scale:** 1:50 (1m = 2cm)  
**Base Size:** 25cm × 25cm  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Start Date:** April 13, 2024  
**Completion Date:** November 2024
