## Design Philosophy

English cottage gardens are characterized by their informal, romantic style with densely packed plantings that appear natural and unplanned. The design typically includes:
- Mixed flowers, herbs, and vegetables
- Self-seeding plants
- Vertical elements (climbers, tall perennials)
- Traditional materials (stone, brick, wood)
- Practical and beautiful plantings
