## Project Vision

A dramatic maritime rescue scene capturing the bravery and dedication of sea rescue services. This diorama will feature a rescue vessel in action, complete with authentic details of modern or historic rescue equipment, rigging, and the dynamic seascape environment.

## Why This Project?

Sea rescue services represent courage, skill, and dedication to saving lives at sea. This project aims to honor those who risk their lives in challenging conditions, while exploring new techniques in building maritime vessels and creating realistic water effects.

## Project Overview

**Build Type:** Scratch build  
**Scale:** 1:72  
**Status:** In Progress - Planning Phase  
**Start Date:** December 2025  
**Challenge:** Vessel construction, water effects, weathering

## Project Goals

- Research and plan rescue vessel design (historic or modern)
- Build detailed rescue vessel with authentic equipment
- Create realistic seascape with wave effects
- Develop weathering techniques for maritime conditions
- Capture the drama and movement of a rescue operation

## Build Approach

1. **Planning & Research** - Study rescue vessels, reference materials, scale calculations
2. **Vessel Construction** - Hull, deck, superstructure, rescue equipment
3. **Seascape Base** - Water surface, waves, foam effects
4. **Details & Weathering** - Paint, rigging, crew figures, environmental effects
5. **Final Assembly** - Integration and presentation

## Materials & Techniques

- **Hull Construction:** Basswood or balsa planking, or carved foam
- **Superstructure:** Styrene sheet, balsa wood, card
- **Water Effects:** Resin, acrylic gel medium, painted effects
- **Weathering:** Salt spray effects, rust, worn paint
- **Details:** Wire rigging, scratch-built equipment, miniature figures

## Inspiration & References

*Research materials and reference images to be gathered during planning phase*
