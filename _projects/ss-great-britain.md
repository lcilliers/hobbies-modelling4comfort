The SS Great Britain was a revolutionary passenger steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Launched in 1843, she was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic. This ambitious project captures one of the most significant vessels in maritime history.

## Project Overview

**Build Type:**Scratch build from pictures**
**Scale:** 1:96  
**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** February 2022  
**Completion:** May 2022  
**Skill Level:** Advanced  
**Difficulty:** Expert - No plans or kit, Complex rigging, iron hull detailing, steam machinery

## Historical Significance

The SS Great Britain represents a pivotal moment in naval engineering:

- **First ocean-going ship** with an iron hull and screw propeller
- **Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel** - one of history's greatest engineers
- **Launched in 1843** in Bristol, England
- **Revolutionized transatlantic travel** with speed and reliability
- **Now a museum ship** in Bristol's Great Western Dockyard

This vessel bridged the gap between the age of sail and modern steam-powered ocean liners. The restoration work in the museum in Bristol is magnificent, inspiring me to capture it in miniature.

## Why This Project?

The SS Great Britain represents a personal fascination with:

- The engineering genius of Brunel
- The transition period from sail to steam
- Bristol's rich maritime heritage
- The preservation and restoration efforts that saved this historic vessel

This will be the most ambitious project undertaken so far, requiring new skills, extensive research, and dedication to historical accuracy.

## Project Goals

- Source kit or build from scratch
- Accurately represent the iron hull construction with proper plating detail
- Reproduce the complex rigging system (combination of steam and sail)
- Imitate on deck features of the period
- Weather and detail to show the ship in her prime operational period

## Build

The build process is described in more detail:

- **Planning and research** - Research building options and background of the ship
- **Hull construction** - Building the hull
- **Decking** - Laying out and constructing all the elements of the deck, including the masts.
- **Sails and rigging** - Preparing the sails and installing all the rigging
- **Decoration** - Painting the model
- **Finish** - Finishing it off to get it presentation ready
