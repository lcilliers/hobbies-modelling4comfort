The SS Great Britain was a revolutionary passenger steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Launched in 1843, she was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic. This ambitious project captures one of the most significant vessels in maritime history.

## Project Overview

**Build Type:**Scratch build from pictures**
**Scale:** 1:96  
**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** February 2022  
**Completion:** May 2022  
**Skill Level:** Advanced  
**Difficulty:** Expert - No plans or kit, Complex rigging, iron hull detailing, steam machinery

## Historical Significance

The SS Great Britain represents a pivotal moment in naval engineering:

- **First ocean-going ship** with an iron hull and screw propeller
- **Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel** - one of history's greatest engineers
- **Launched in 1843** in Bristol, England
- **Revolutionized transatlantic travel** with speed and reliability
- **Now a museum ship** in Bristol's Great Western Dockyard

This vessel bridged the gap between the age of sail and modern steam-powered ocean liners. The restoration work in the museum in Bristol is magnificent, inspiring me to capture it in miniature.

## Project Goals

- Source kit or build from scratch
- Accurately represent the iron hull construction with proper plating detail
- Reproduce the complex rigging system (combination of steam and sail)
- Imitate on deck features of the period
- Weather and detail to show the ship in her prime operational period

## Planning Phase

Currently researching and gathering:

- **Reference materials** - Historical drawings, photographs, museum documentation
- **Kit selection** - Evaluating available kits or planning scratch-build approach
- **Scale determination** - Balancing detail requirements with workspace constraints
- **Materials sourcing** - Brass etchings, wooden deck materials, rigging supplies
- **Technique development** - Iron plating effects, steam machinery details

## Planned Features

### Hull & Structure
- Detailed iron plating with rivet work
- Authentic waterline and copper bottom
- Proper deck planking with caulking lines
- Accurate funnel and ventilation details

### Rigging & Sails
- Six-masted sailing rig (as originally configured)
- Authentic rope work and tackle
- Period-correct sail material and weathering
- Running and standing rigging differentiated

### Propulsion Systems
- Visible propeller and shaft
- Steam engine details (if cutaway approach)
- Funnel with realistic weathering
- Coal bunker details

### Deck Details
- Passenger accommodations
- Cargo handling equipment
- Period navigation instruments
- Crew work areas

## Challenges Anticipated

**Technical:**
- Combining iron hull appearance with model materials
- Balancing sail and steam propulsion elements
- Achieving proper scale for intricate machinery
- Managing the large size and complexity

**Research:**
- Finding accurate historical references for specific periods
- Determining authentic color schemes and markings
- Understanding the evolution of the ship through various refits

**Skills Required:**
- Advanced metalwork techniques for hull plating
- Scratch-building steam machinery components
- Complex rigging for multiple mast configurations
- Photo-etched brass work for fine details

## Learning Objectives

This project will develop skills in:

- **Metal finishing techniques** for iron hull effects
- **Mechanical modeling** for steam propulsion systems
- **Mixed-material construction** combining wood, metal, and plastic
- **Historical research** and accuracy in maritime modeling
- **Advanced rigging** for transitional steam-sail vessels

## Research Resources

Key sources being consulted:

- SS Great Britain Museum archives
- Brunel Institute research collections
- Contemporary maritime journals and newspapers
- Modern engineering analyses of her construction
- Photography from restoration project

## Timeline (Tentative)

**Phase 1: Research & Planning** (2-3 months)
- Complete historical research
- Finalize kit selection or scratch-build plans
- Gather all materials and tools
- Develop construction sequence

**Phase 2: Hull Construction** (4-6 months)
- Build basic hull structure
- Add iron plating details
- Complete waterline and bottom
- Deck installation and detailing

**Phase 3: Superstructure** (2-3 months)
- Funnel construction and weathering
- Deck houses and cabins
- Mast installation
- Propulsion system details

**Phase 4: Rigging** (3-4 months)
- Standing rigging installation
- Running rigging and blocks
- Sail making and attachment
- Final adjustments and tensioning

**Phase 5: Finishing & Display** (1-2 months)
- Final weathering and details
- Base construction
- Photography setup
- Documentation

## Why This Project?

The SS Great Britain represents a personal fascination with:

- The engineering genius of Brunel
- The transition period from sail to steam
- Bristol's rich maritime heritage
- The preservation and restoration efforts that saved this historic vessel

This will be the most ambitious project undertaken so far, requiring new skills, extensive research, and dedication to historical accuracy.
