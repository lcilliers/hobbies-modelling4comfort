## Project Overview

A detailed scratch-built diorama featuring a traditional southern English cottage with brick and flint walls, steeply pitched gable roof, and authentic period architecture set within a cottage garden landscape.

## Project Details

**Scale:** TBD (to be confirmed by builder)  
**Construction Method:** Scratch-built using wood slat frame with paper substrate  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Start Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Completion Date:** December 1, 2025  
**Build Duration:** Approximately 5 months  
**Status:** Physically complete, documentation in progress

## Architectural Style

This cottage is based on traditional southern English countryside architecture, particularly characteristic of counties like Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent:

**Key Features:**
- Steeply pitched gable roof
- Brick and flint walls (typical of flint-abundant regions)
- Decorative brickwork around windows and doors
- Prominent chimney
- Cottage garden with flowers and fencing
- Weathered, lived-in appearance

## Construction Technique

**Innovative Wood Frame Method:**
- Thin wood slats on paper substrate provide structural rigidity
- Paper surface allows excellent modeling paste adhesion
- Reduces risk of cracking or flaking

**Wall Construction:**
- Modeling paste applied to prepared paper surface
- Flexible stencil technique for brick patterns
- Sharp tools for irregular flint stone details
- Optional crushed stone/beads for 3D texture

**Finishing:**
- Slow, even drying to prevent warping
- Sealed with matte varnish or diluted PVA
- Dry brushing and washes to enhance texture
- Flint: dark grey base with white/grey highlights
- Brick: burnt sienna/terracotta with white mortar lines

## Next Steps

**Human Input Required:**
1. Review and expand all `[NEEDS MORE]` sections in source narrative files
2. Verify timeline and technical details  
3. Add personal experiences, challenges, and learning moments
4. Confirm materials list and specifications
5. Validate all `[AI-CHECK]` sections for accuracy
6. Select which photos to use for site (from 116 available)
7. Optimize selected photos to Web-Optimized folders
8. Create individual build log markdown files
9. Convert narrative to final Jekyll markdown format
10. Update this page with complete validated content

**Current Status:** Ready for human narrative expansion
