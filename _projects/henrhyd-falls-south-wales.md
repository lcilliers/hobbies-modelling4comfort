## Capturing Wales' Tallest Waterfall in Miniature

**Location Inspired:** Henrhyd Falls, Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) National Park, Powys  
**Real-World Height:** 27 meters (90 feet) - tallest in South Wales  
**Diorama Scale:** 1:250  
**Base Size:** 25cm × 25cm  
**Status:** Completed November 2025

## Project Overview

Henrhyd Falls cascades dramatically through the wooded Graig Llech Gorge in the Brecon Beacons National Park. This diorama captures the dramatic verticality of Wales' tallest southern waterfall, the moss-covered rocky cliffs, and the ancient woodland that thrives in this temperate rainforest microclimate. The falls gained international fame as the filming location for the Batcave entrance in *The Dark Knight Rises*.

**Key Features:**
- Dramatic 27-meter waterfall represented at 1:250 scale (~11cm drop)
- Steep rocky cliff face with layered rock formations
- Hidden path winding behind the falls
- Dense Welsh woodland - sessile oak, ash, alder
- Moss and fern-covered boulders
- Cascading water effects over rocky pool

## The Real Henrhyd Falls

**Location:** Henrhyd, Coelbren, Powys, SA10 9PH  
**Height:** 27 meters - the tallest waterfall in South Wales  
**Setting:** Graig Llech Gorge, Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons) National Park

The area is characterized by ancient woodland thriving in the moist, shaded environment created by the gorge and waterfall spray - a rare temperate rainforest microclimate in the UK. Sessile oak and ash dominate the canopy, with alder and willow near the riverbanks. The forest floor is rich with mosses, liverworts, ferns, wood sorrel, wild garlic, and seasonal bluebells. Lichens and mosses grow abundantly on tree trunks and rocks, indicating exceptionally clean air and high humidity.

## Diorama Design & Planning

### Scale Considerations

**Scale:** 1:250  
**Base Size:** 25cm × 25cm (representing approximately 62.5m × 62.5m real-world area)  
**Waterfall Height:** ~11cm (representing 27m actual drop)

### Composition Planning

- **Waterfall Position:** Center-top, with 16cm wide cliff section
- **Stream Path:** Runs diagonally from waterfall pool toward bottom-left with rocky cascades  
- **Pathway:** Curves from mid-right to top-right, leading behind the falls
- **Foliage Zones:** Dense tree clusters along top and right edges for framing
- **Rock Features:** Large boulders concentrated on left side for elevation contrast

### Reference Research

Extensive photographic research documented authentic Welsh geology, woodland characteristics, and water behavior:

- **Waterfall & Water:** 8 reference images studying flow patterns, spray effects, pool formation
- **Landscape Views:** 22 reference images capturing the gorge, cliff formations, and overall scene composition
- **Rock Formations:** 11 reference images of Welsh coastal and inland rock strata, geological folds, limestone formations
- **Welsh Woodland:** 17 reference images documenting ancient oak/ash forests, beech woodlands, and temperate rainforest characteristics
- **AI Design Studies:** 4 conceptual renderings exploring composition and scale representation

## Build Approach

This project documentation follows an iterative build log structure, capturing the authentic journey from concept to completion.

### Build Timeline

**October 23, 2025 - November 2025** (approximately 3 weeks)

### Construction Journey

#### [Build Log #001: Concept, Research & Base Construction]({{ '/builds/henrhyd-falls-south-wales/001-planning/' | relative_url }})

**Timeline:** 23 October - 2 November 2025

The project began with an AI concept illustration to validate scale feasibility. Research extended to collecting 62 reference images across five categories: AI design studies, waterfall flow patterns, Henrhyd Falls site photos, Welsh rock formations, and ancient woodland character. The base construction involved creating a cooked paper pulp mixture (shredded paper, flour, water, vinegar, PVA, filler) that proved highly successful after initial cracking problems. Critical lesson: build in thin 2-3cm layers with thorough drying between applications. The 25×25cm plywood base supports 18cm of vertical terrain representing the dramatic gorge.

**Key Achievement:** Established successful paper pulp technique; validated 1:250 scale would work

#### Build Log #002: Rock Cliff Formation & Geological Layers

[TODO: Add narrative when Build Log 2 is completed]

**Focus:** Carving and texturing the vertical cliff face with authentic Welsh sedimentary layering

#### Build Log #003: Waterfall Construction & Water Effects

[TODO: Add narrative when Build Log 3 is completed]

**Focus:** Creating the 10cm waterfall drop using clear resin and cotton batting for spray effects

#### Build Log #004: Welsh Woodland Vegetation & Temperate Rainforest

[TODO: Add narrative when Build Log 4 is completed]

**Focus:** Building sessile oak and ash trees with wire armatures; moss-covered forest floor

#### Build Log #005: Pathway Behind Falls & Final Details

[TODO: Add narrative when Build Log 5 is completed]

**Focus:** Adding the famous hidden pathway and atmospheric finishing touches

#### Build Log #006: Weathering, Photography & Completion

[TODO: Add narrative when Build Log 6 is completed]

**Focus:** Final weathering, project photography, and reflection on techniques learned

## Historical & Cultural Context

Henrhyd Falls is located on the Nant Llech river near Coelbren in the Brecon Beacons. The 27-meter drop makes it the highest waterfall in South Wales. The site is managed by the National Trust and is a popular destination for hikers exploring the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park.

The falls gained international recognition as a filming location for Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), where the dramatic plunge and hidden ledge behind the waterfall served as the entrance to the Batcave.

The surrounding ancient woodland represents a precious temperate rainforest ecosystem - rare in the UK and supporting exceptional biodiversity due to the constant moisture from waterfall spray and the sheltered gorge environment.
