## Project Overview

This is a sample diorama project showcasing a World War 2 winter scene. The project features detailed weathering, realistic snow effects, and careful attention to historical accuracy.

## Scale and Subject

- **Scale**: 1:35
- **Era**: World War 2, Eastern Front
- **Season**: Winter 1944
- **Manufacturer**: Tamiya/Dragon

## Build Goals

The main objectives for this project are:

1. Create realistic snow and ice effects
2. Practice advanced weathering techniques
3. Develop atmospheric winter scene lighting
4. Tell a compelling story through composition

## Materials and Tools

### Kits Used
- Tamiya German Tank Crew
- Dragon Sd.Kfz Vehicle
- Miniart Accessories Set

### Special Materials
- AK Interactive Winter Weathering Set
- Vallejo Snow Texture
- Woodland Scenics Static Grass
- Realistic Water Effects

## Build Progress

### Phase 1: Assembly (Completed)
- All figures assembled and test-fitted
- Vehicle assembled with hatches positioned open
- Base structure created from insulation foam

### Phase 2: Painting (In Progress)
- Base colors applied to all elements
- Initial weathering tests on scrap pieces
- Working on figure skin tones

### Phase 3: Weathering (Upcoming)
- Chipping and paint wear
- Mud and dirt effects
- Snow accumulation

### Phase 4: Final Assembly (Upcoming)
- Positioning all elements
- Creating final snow effects
- Adding small details and final touches

## Techniques Applied

- Pre-shading and post-shading
- Oil paint weathering
- Pigment application
- Snow texture layering

## Lessons Learned

Working with winter scenes requires patience and restraint. Too much snow can overwhelm the scene, while too little doesn't convey the harsh conditions. Finding the right balance is key.

## Next Steps

1. Complete figure painting
2. Start vehicle weathering
3. Test snow effects on small section
4. Begin final assembly once satisfied with tests
